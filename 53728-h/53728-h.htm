<h2><span class="pagenum1"><a id="page5a"></a>[p.5a]</span> PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The following pages are the result of investigations and the collection
of facts and arguments from a great variety of sources, originally made
and presented in aid of the discussions on the subject during the past
six or eight months.</p>

<p>The most eminent and reliable authorities for nearly half a century,
that is, from 1832 to 1865, including the late reports from India,
have been carefully examined, and such late discoveries, facts, and
arguments collected, as seemed to throw light upon the subject, or in
any degree to indicate or direct to a general principle of practice.</p>

<p>The various experiments instituted for the cure of the disease have
been carefully investigated, and the principle evolved explained
whenever any advantage was derived from the same.</p>

<p>In all these we have diligently searched for the cause of the failure
of "remedial agents," so uniformly admitted, and have endeavored to
present the results clearly and fully in the body of the work.</p>

<p>Our statistics are collected from reliable sources, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page6"></a>[p.6a]</span> are very
brief, and introduced in aid of the main object,&mdash;the establishment of
a general principle of practice.</p>

<p>The different modes of practice are from the most distinguished authors
of the different Schools of Medicine, and non-professional gentlemen;
condensed and exhibited mainly in their own language, to show their
conformity or non-conformity to the Pathology of the disease.</p>

<p>In all we have kept constantly in view the pathology of the disease,
whose "dictates" have governed us in the exhibition and establishment
of a general principle of rational practice, confirmed by observation
and experience, which, if accepted and carried out by the profession,
we hope and trust will save a very large proportion of those attacked
by "this most acute of acute diseases."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;Origin and Development.</span></h3>


<p>Epidemics have occasionally prevailed in all ages. Sometimes they
have been circumscribed in their influence, and limited to particular
localities; while at other periods they have taken a wider range and
extended over larger sections, inflicting the most lamentable results,
and augmenting the bills of mortality to an incredible degree.</p>

<p>The earlier writers have given some account of these diseases, which
have occasionally prevailed as very fatal and devastating epidemics;
surpassing all other diseases in their mysterious origin, in their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8"></a>[p.8]</span> rapid extension, and in the duration of their prevalence. In
the East,&mdash;in Egypt, and on the eastern border of the Mediterranean,
fearful epidemics have prevailed from time immemorial. They have often
proved very destructive, especially in the Middle Ages, and as late
as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. During the prevalence of
the "Pestis," which raged throughout Europe between the years 1347
and 1350, according to computation, a fourth part of the inhabitants
of this part of the globe was carried off. The estimates of the vast
numbers swept away by its repeated occurrence and prevalence appear
quite incredible.</p>

<p>During the time it raged at Marseilles in 1720, it is reported that in
the Charity Hospital there were admitted from October 3d to February
28th, 1,013 patients, of whom 585 died; and during the same period, in
another hospital, there were admitted from October to July 3d, 1,512
patients, of whom 820 died. The population of Marseilles previous to
the occurrence <span class="pagenum"><a id="page9"></a>[p.9]</span> of the disease was estimated at about 90,000, of
whom 40,000 died; leaving only about 10,000 of the whole population who
had not been attacked or in any way affected; so that the record shows
the appalling mortality of fifty per cent. of those who were attacked.</p>

<p>The bills of mortality in 1770 and 1771 were as appalling as any
arising from epidemics of a later day. A very extended notice of
the "Pestis" as it raged in Moscow in the year 1771 is given by M.
Gerardin, who, quoting from the published statistics, observes: "In
April, the deaths were 744; May, 851; June, 1,099; July, 1,708; August,
7,268; September, 21,401; October, 17,561; November, 5,235; December,
805"; making a total in nine months of 56,672, which is considerably
less than the estimate given by De Mertens, who thinks the whole number
carried off by this pestilence, from the city alone, cannot be less
than 80,000. These statistics bear a striking resemblance to those of
the Epidemic Cholera, whose fatality is materially <span class="pagenum"><a id="page10"></a>[p.10]</span> varied by
the seasons of the year; the greatest being usually at the close of
Summer or the beginning of Autumn. There are, in short, many points of
resemblance in this and former epidemics to that of the Cholera, which
naturally lead to the supposition that all have had a common origin,
if, indeed, they be in many respects dissimilar.</p>

<p>Their pestilential character, their extended influence, and their great
fatality, rendered their appearance and progress a special terror to
physicians, and melancholy apprehension to the people. They seem to
have been regarded as the manifestation of an invisible power, which
directed and guided "the pestilence that walketh in darkness" and "the
destruction that wasteth at noon-day;" a visitation or chastisement
over which human ingenuity and medical skill had little control. Under
these impressions, the earlier physicians labored and endeavored to
satisfy the great mass of mind that these occasional and special
developments of disease arose from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page11"></a>[p.11]</span> natural causes, and were
subject to certain natural laws. They ascribed their origin to the
commingling of some specific poison in the food, and drink, and air,
which, through these "media," was received into the system.</p>

<p>Subsequently, they seem to have made some advance on this theory, and
considered the extreme Summer heat&mdash;especially the intense heat of the
sun in a dry season&mdash;the emanations from stagnant waters, and the miasm
exhaled from the soil, and from putrid bodies of animals, as the chief
causes of all epidemics. These views prevailed for a very long period,
and have undergone no very remarkable change from the observations and
discoveries of centuries.</p>

<p>Modern and quite recent writers have advanced nearly the
same doctrines, embracing, however, the principal sources of
insalubrity&mdash;the malarious and miasmatic influences; and have assigned
as the cause of epidemics, especially that of Cholera, a peculiar
constitution of the atmosphere, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page12"></a>[p.12]</span> and certain predisposing
causes combining with each other, so that an association or union of
these two independent and individual causes are necessary and essential
to the production of the disease.</p>

<p>Eminent scholars and pathologists have, during the century last past,
patiently searched for its final cause, without arriving at any better,
wiser, or more satisfactory conclusion than the earlier writers, who
regarded it a poison, commingled with the food they ate, the water they
drank, and the air they breathed. The modern writers, according to the
more popular views, almost universally adopt the hypothesis that the
remote or final cause of the Cholera is a specific poison; for at no
period has a person in good health in this or any other country been
known in a few minutes to be shriveled up, his face and extremities to
turn purple, his whole body to become of an icy coldness, and with or
without vomiting a peculiar fluid, like rice-water, to die in a few
hours, except under the influence of poison. That this disease, so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page13"></a>[p.13]</span> appalling and destructive in its effects, and so mysterious
in its wanderings, should spread over countries in respect to climate,
soil, geological formations, and as to the moral and physical habits of
the population, so utterly opposite to those where it first originated,
is only explicable on the hypothesis of its propagation on the
principle of a specific disease-poison.</p>

<p>How and in what manner it travels has not been satisfactorily
determined. Whether independent of any and all human agency, or
absolutely dependent on ordinary communication and intercourse of
tribes, and peoples, and nations, is as yet unsettled. It is, however,
a matter not of so much consequence as the fact that, in all its
nomadic life, it retains unchanged its youthful disposition, vigor and
energy. It seldom shows any inclination to associate, or coalesce, or
even adopt the milder habits and manners of others.</p>

<p>Perhaps some idea of its character may be obtained from a microscopic
view of its birthplace and its surroundings. Whether <span class="pagenum"><a id="page14"></a>[p.14]</span> the
locality of its irruption in 1629, or that of 1817, whence it spread
over the greater part of the globe, be entitled to the unenviable
distinction of fostering its gestation, concealing and protecting its
birth, and nursing its infancy, is immaterial;&mdash;since the similarity
of these localities strikingly illustrates its cause and ultimate
development.</p>

<p>On the north side of the island of Java, about 6° S. lat. and 107° E.
long., near the mouth of the river Jacatra, is situated Batavia, in
the midst of swamps and marshes, surrounded by trees and jungle,
which prevent the exhalations from being carried off by a free
circulation of the air, and render the town peculiarly obnoxious to
marsh miasmata. Besides this, all the principal streets are traversed
by canals, planted on each side with rows of trees, over which there
are bridges at the end of almost every street. These canals are the
common receptacles for all the filth of the town. In the dry season
their stagnant and diminished waters emit a most intolerable stench,
while <span class="pagenum"><a id="page15"></a>[p.15]</span> in the wet season they overflow their banks and leave
a quantity of offensive slime. From these united causes, it is not
surprising that Batavia has been considered the most unhealthy spot
in the world, and has been designated the store-house of disease.
According to Raynal, the number of sailors and soldiers alone who died
in the hospitals averaged 1,400 annually for sixty years, and the total
amount of deaths in twenty-two years exceeded a million of souls. The
city was inclosed by a wall of coral rock, with a stream of water on
each side within and without. Few Europeans, however, sleep within the
town, as the night air is considered very baneful. The inhabitants,
possibly, as an antidote against the noxious effluvia arising from
the swamps and canals, continually burn aromatic woods and resins,
and scatter about a profusion of odoriferous flowers, of which there
are great abundance and variety. During the prosperity of the Dutch
East India Company, Batavia obtained the title of Queen of the East,
as the resources of all other districts were sacrificed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16"></a>[p.16]</span> to
its exclusive commerce. Here, in this noted locality, was the Cholera
bred and reared in 1629, under circumstances of great significance,
admirably adapted to convey some idea of its cause and character.</p>

<p>A learned professor, speaking of the diseases of India, observes:
"<span class="smcap">Cholera</span> is the most acute of acute diseases. It seems to
have existed in Batavia as far back as 1629; and it has been known
to prevail as an occasional epidemic in India at different years and
places from 1774 to 1817. Since then it has been endemic, and is a
disease whose germs are essentially maintained in, or upon the soil.
It annually recurs at many of our large stations, commencing generally
at the beginning of the hot season, but sometimes occurring in the
rainy and cold season. Its greatest proclivity to propagation is
amongst populations living in low, damp, crowded, and ill-ventilated
situations, especially if the water supply is impure. Nearly all
the diseases fatal in India are accompanied by profuse discharges,
with which the air, water, linen, bedding, closets, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page17"></a>[p.17]</span> walls
of hospitals, and barracks become more or less infected; so that the
'Materies Morbi' come into contact with all the inmates of buildings
where the disease prevails."</p>

<p>Its origin, or reappearance in 1817, is not in any respect essentially
different from its earlier development on the Jacatra. The River
Ganges, in India, like the Nile in Egypt, flows for a long distance
through a low, level country, which it annually inundates. Dividing its
waters about 200 miles from the sea, the Delta of the Ganges commences
and continues its variegated and checkered surface, till, approaching
the borders of the sea, it presents a peculiar aspect, being composed
of a labyrinth of creeks and rivers, called "The Sunderbunds," with
numerous islands, covered with the profuse and rank vegetation called
"jungle," affording haunts to numerous tigers and other beasts of prey.
This large river, "a Deity of the Hindoo," is subject to an annual
freshet, often rising to the height of 32 feet in the month of July;
when all the lower parts of the country adjoining the Ganges, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page18"></a>[p.18]</span>
as well as the Burrumpooter, are overflowed for a width of one hundred
miles; nothing appearing but villages, trees, and sites of some places
that have been deserted. Here in this vast pest-house, where every
conceivable vegetable and animal substance is left upon the soil by
the retiring inundation, exposed to the heat and dews of a tropical
climate&mdash;where, too, noisome and infectious diseases have prevailed for
centuries, the Epidemic Cholera is said to have arisen and acquired its
strength and full development. A fit origin for a fatal and devastating
pestilence.</p>

<p>To this low, insalubrious, and festering locality, this vast
pest-house, where so many noxious and noisome diseases are generated,
and where so many epidemics have arisen and so often swept over the
surrounding regions with most fatal and desolating effects, is ascribed
the birthplace of the Epidemic Cholera of 1817. Here it is said to have
first made its appearance at Jessore&mdash;a populous town in the centre
of the Delta of the Ganges; whence attaining its growth <span class="pagenum"><a id="page19"></a>[p.19]</span> and
power, it has extended its influence as from a common centre, and
marked its progress with hecatombs of victims in the direction of
almost every point of the compass.</p>

<p>Here we may remark, that it is not our intention to travel over the
whole ground embraced by the subject under consideration; but, on
the contrary, to present in this treatise only a cursory view of a
few prominent features which may interest and aid in the important
object of deducing from the pathology and the varied phenomena of the
Cholera some general principle of practice. For this, and to this,
our labor and our investigations are directed. Availing ourselves of
every source of information within our reach, and relying in part on
the observations and experience of others, we shall aim to present
such facts and arguments as will shed light upon the subject, and aid
in the accomplishment of this desirable object. However difficult this
may appear, it is nevertheless believed to be within the province of
science and unbiased reason.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page20"></a>[p.20]</span> <span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;Progress and Fatality.</span></h3>

<p>The disease in 1817 appeared on the Delta of the Ganges, and gradually
extending its influence, swept over various countries with terrible
severity. Having here acquired its full development, and manifesting
an indomitable determination to itinerate, it starts upon its lethean
errand, and soon shows a capacity and power to overcome every obstacle
opposed to its progress, and to pursue its course unchecked and even
unretarded by any natural or artificial barrier. It soon traversed
India, and in the succeeding season spread over adjacent countries,
visiting in 1818 the Indian Peninsula, the Burmese Empire, the Kingdom
of Aracan, and the Peninsula of Malacca. In 1819 it reached Sumatra,
Singapore, and various other islands situated along the coast on either
border of this vast peninsula.</p>

<p>During the year 1820, pursuing steadily its progress eastward, it
reached Tonquin, Southern China, Canton, the Philippine, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page21"></a>[p.21]</span>
numerous other places and islands in that direction. In 1821 it visited
Java&mdash;the place of its earlier nativity&mdash;Madura, Borneo, and many other
places in the Indian Archipelago. During the years 1822, 1823 and 1824,
it continued to spread over the vast and populous regions of Central
and Northern China and the numerous islands upon the coast, and in 1827
prevailed in Chinese Tartary, leaving few places in all these different
countries on the continent, or even on the islands bordering on the
eastern coast, unscathed by its terrible ravages and depopulating
influence.</p>

<p>During the same period, its progress westward has been uninterrupted,
and attended with results no less remarkable. It has baffled all
attempts to check or even retard its onward course, or mitigate its
appalling effects. In July, 1821, it had reached Muscat in Arabia, and
thence extended its influence to the populous cities and villages along
the Persian Gulf. During the same season it appeared in Persia, and
continued to ravage the principal cities <span class="pagenum"><a id="page22"></a>[p.22]</span> and towns of that
empire for four successive years. At Bassorah and Bagdad it broke out
in July, 1821, and thence extended its desolating influence westward
to the Red and Mediterranean Seas, carrying off vast numbers of the
inhabitants of the populous cities of Mesopotamia, Syria, and Judea.</p>

<p>In 1822 it prevailed among the nomadic and Tartar tribes in Central
Asia and in the northern Persian Provinces, and in 1823 broke out on
the Georgian frontiers of Russia, at Orenburg on the River Ural, and
at Astrachan on the Volga. Here its western course was apparently
interrupted. There was, for a short period, an interval of complete
immunity from its presence. Along the border of the Russian Provinces
the disease had entirely disappeared, and seemed inclined to retrace
its course and return to the home of its birth. But the fond
anticipations of Europeans were disappointed; the destroyer was not to
be arrested and turned back in his progress over the earth; his march
was onward, his demands imperative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page23"></a>[p.23]</span> Hence, in the month of June, 1830, the disease reappeared in
a Persian province on the southern shore of the Caspian, and again at
Astrachan, on the Volga, in July, where it prevailed with such unwonted
violence that, before the close of August, more than 4,000 persons had
died of it in the city, and 21,270 in the province. From its interval
of repose, it would seem to have recuperated its strength and vigor for
the lethean work awaiting its progress. Ascending the Volga, it reached
Moscow, became prevalent there in September, and continued with great
severity till February, 1831. Here it attacked, in the city, about
9,000 persons, of whom more than one-half died. Continuing its advance,
it reached Riga about the middle of May, and St. Petersburg on the 26th
June.</p>

<p>From Astrachan it also directed its course towards the northern coast
of the Black Sea, and thence along the course of the rivers into
the central parts of Russia. It reached Poland in January, 1831,
accompanied the Russian army in its various marches and encampments
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page24"></a>[p.24]</span> during the subjugation of that country, and proved very
destructive in Warsaw and many other places during April and May. It
appeared at Dantzic in May, and in June at Lemburg, Cracow, and various
other places and sections of country, extending through Gallicia,
Hungary, and reaching Berlin and Hamburg in August and September, and
Vienna about the same time.</p>

<p>Smyrna was visited in September, and Constantinople soon afterwards. It
is reported that the pestilence was conveyed by a caravan from Mecca
to Cairo in August, 1831, some thousands having died on the road;
and, by the middle of September, 10,400 Mohammedans, besides Jews and
Christians, had died of it in this latter city.</p>

<p>Passing from the western coast of the continent, on nearly the same
parallels of latitude, it found its way over the Northern Sea to the
British Isles, and made a lodgment, first, on the northeastern coast
of England, in October, 1831, at Sunderland, situated in latitude 55°
north, whence it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page25"></a>[p.25]</span> prevailed and extended its influence over
this section, evincing the same malignant and lethean character it had
manifested in its progress over the continent. Its course thus far has
been marked with unparalleled fatality.</p>

<p>It made its first appearance in Scotland, at Haddington, in December,
1831, and at Edinburgh in January. In these and various other places it
prevailed for some months, and, as warm weather came on, increased in
severity, and carried off a large percentage of those attacked. After
spreading thus over the northern section, and rioting for months in the
more populous cities and towns, it made its appearance in London on
the 14th February, 1832, where it found an abundance of material for
recuperating its strength and multiplying its forces, and soon after
spread over various other places in the United Kingdom, inflicting
the most appalling bills of mortality. In short, its progress over
this country has been attended with the same destructive influence
and the same lamentable consequences as on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page26"></a>[p.26]</span> the continent. No
change, modification, or softening of its disposition or character has
arisen from its passage over the Northern Sea, nor from the refreshing
influences of a purer atmosphere.</p>

<p>It appeared in Calais on the 12th, and at Paris on the 26th of March,
1832, where it continued in these and other cities and villages for
some months with its accustomed severity. During the season it raged
throughout the vast empire, and swept away an immense number of its
inhabitants. During the succeeding years, 1833 and 1834, it traversed
Spain, and proved very destructive in many of its larger cities and
villages.</p>

<p>In the mean time, continuing its course from the British Isles
westward, unchecked by the prevailing western winds and the broad
expanse of the Atlantic Ocean, over which it passes a distance of
nearly three thousand miles, and makes its first appearance on the
American continent at Quebec, Lower Canada, on the 8th June, 1832, and
reaches Montreal on the 10th of the same <span class="pagenum"><a id="page27"></a>[p.27]</span> month. From these
cities it rapidly spread in all directions, prevailing in the towns and
villages on the St. Lawrence and its tributaries, and soon extended
along the chain of lakes, dividing the Provinces from the United
States, visiting the principal ports on either shore. It exhibited
in all these places its peculiar epidemic character, and proved
excessively violent and fatal wherever it appeared.</p>

<p>Its first irruption in New York was on the 24th June, 1832, sixteen
days after its appearance at Quebec, and at Albany, midway between
the two former cities, on the 3d July. From New York it extended its
influence to Flatbush and Gravesend, Long Island, where it appeared on
the 5th July, and on the same day and date at the city of Philadelphia.
It broke out at Rochester on the 12th and at Buffalo&mdash;July.</p>

<p>Thus, while it was making its way westward along the great chain of
lakes, towards the arteries of the Great West, it was, at the same
time, steadily pursuing its uninterrupted course along the coast,
visiting the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page28"></a>[p.28]</span> main cities, and spreading from these as from
common centres over the intermediate towns and villages. In its
progress it reached Baltimore on the 22d August, and the City of
Washington on the 28th of the same month.</p>

<p>Thence it continued its course to Richmond, Norfolk, Edenton, and
various other cities along the Atlantic and Gulf coast.</p>

<p>It appeared at New Orleans in the Autumn of 1832, during the existence
of a severe epidemic of yellow fever, and apparently subsided on the
disappearance of the fever. Sporadic cases, however, occurred during
the Winter, and in the opening of Spring it broke out with unwonted
vigor and severity, and thence spread, according to its accustomed
laws of itineracy, along the rivers into the interior of the States
bordering upon the Mississippi and the Gulf coast, and raged throughout
Louisiana and Texas with unusual violence and fatality.</p>

<p>In 1832, 1833, and 1834 it prevailed throughout the Mississippi Valley
with great fatality, especially in the principal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page29"></a>[p.29]</span> cities,
villages and towns situated upon its navigable waters. Here, after
intervals of entire immunity from its presence, it occasionally
reappeared in some of the larger cities with renewed vigor and power,
and swept off vast numbers of the inhabitants. In no section of the
States have greater numbers, compared with the whole population, fallen
victims to it than in the fertile and sparsely settled prairies of the
South and West.</p>

<p>Thus, from the North, and at a later date from the South, extending
its influence along the principal rivers into the interior, it swept
over the States, prevailing in some places in the Valley of the
Mississippi as late as 1836. In short, it reappeared in 1834 in many
cities and places where it had before prevailed, and again spread over
a considerable portion of the country with unprecedented fatality.</p>

<p>In 1833, the disease appeared at Havana and Matanzas, and prevailed on
the island for several months with great fatality, especially among the
colored people. During <span class="pagenum"><a id="page30"></a>[p.30]</span> the same season it appeared in August
at Tampico, Campeachy, Vera Cruz, and the city of Mexico, proving
especially violent and destructive in these and other cities of the
Republic. In Central America it is said to have attacked the army, and
in a very short period to have swept away a very large proportion of
its officers and men.</p>

<p>Thus, it appears that the epidemic or Asiatic Cholera, from its first
irruption on the northern coast, spread over the greater part of the
North American Continent in the space of two years, and has several
times reappeared in different sections in its peculiar malignant
character, spreading on each occasion over a greater or less extent
of territory with the same uniform and destructive influence. Neither
time, nor science, nor professional skill has thus far appeared to
soften its character, or mitigate its severity.</p>

<p>When the disease had fully assumed its epidemic or malignant type in
India, in 1817, its rate of mortality was everywhere in that vast
territory excessively high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page31"></a>[p.31]</span> According to the most reliable reports, the cases occurring
in the earlier period of an irruption were generally fatal, few only
surviving the attack; while of those occurring when the disease was
on the decline, a greater proportion recovered. We read of numerous
instances where one-third, one-half, two-thirds, and even nine-tenths
of those seized with Cholera perished, and again of some places where
one-fifth, one-fourth, and in some instances one-third of entire
populations were cut off in a very short period by this disease. But
without attempting to give the statistics of cholera in this part of
the world, or even in Europe or America, we may present a few instances
of mortality, going to show the great percentage of loss by this
singular disease during its ravages from 1817 to 1837.</p>

<p>In Siam, it is said 20,000 persons fell victims to it in twelve days.
The inhabitants are remarkable for their uncleanly habits, and crowded,
ill-ventilated tenements.</p>

<p>In Sicily, 16,000 died of cholera in 1832, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page32"></a>[p.32]</span> at Catania; in
Palermo, 40,000. These cities are represented as being filthy in the
extreme, and the personal habits of the people so uncleanly, and the
houses so crowded, that it is a matter of surprise the mortality was
not greater.</p>

<p>In Bassorah and Bagdad, situated in low, unhealthy localities, and
exposed to a damp, insalubrious atmosphere, which, in the warmer
season, is often essentially impregnated with miasmata and offensive
exhalations from animal and vegetable decomposition, both within and
without their inclosures, it is affirmed that more than one-third of
their entire populations were carried off in less than one month.</p>

<p>In the Province of Caucasus, out of 16,000 attacked by the disease,
10,000 died. In Russia, out of 54,000 attacked in 1830, it is said more
than 31,000 died.</p>

<p>In Hungary, it is reported that the whole number affected by the
disease was about 400,000, of whom more than one-half died.</p>

<p>It is officially stated that the total number&mdash;the military
excepted&mdash;of those affected <span class="pagenum"><a id="page33"></a>[p.33]</span> with cholera in France, from its
first appearance at Calais, March 15, 1832, to January 1st, 1833, is
230,000, and the deaths 95,000.</p>

<p>In England, the whole number of cases of Cholera is reported to be
49,594, and the number of deaths 14,807. In London there were 11,020
cases, of which 5,274 were fatal. In Wales there were 1,436 cases, of
which 498 proved fatal. In Ireland, from its first irruption in 1832
to March, 1833, there had occurred 54,552 cases of cholera, of which
21,171 were fatal.</p>

<p>In Quebec, from June 9th to September 2d, 1832, there had occurred in
that city alone no less than 5,783 cases of cholera, of which 2,218
were fatal. In Montreal, from June 10th to September 21st, there were
4,440 cases, and 1,904 deaths reported.</p>

<p>In New York, from July 4th to August 28th, in 1832, there had occurred
5,814 cases of cholera, and 2,935 deaths by the same disease. In
Philadelphia, from July 4th to August 28th, 1832, there were reported
2,314 cases of cholera, of which 935 were fatal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page34"></a>[p.34]</span> In many of our Southern and Western cities and villages the
percentage of loss from the prevalence of cholera is considerably
higher than the general average, compared with the data given above.
The mortality varies materially in different localities, and, indeed,
becomes very much augmented by the prevalence of those influences
which particularly favor the vegetation, and are especially concerned
in the production of zymotic diseases, whether in the lower or higher
latitudes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Section III.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Causes&mdash;Propagation.</span></h3>

<p>The remote or final cause is essentially of miasmatic origin, developed
under certain atmospheric and terrestrial local conditions, not well
defined or fully understood. In its nature and essence, it constitutes
a peculiar disease-poison, which is now generally admitted to be, in
one way or another, absorbed, and infects the blood, inducing a primary
disease of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page35"></a>[p.35]</span> this vital fluid, and directly depressing and
deranging the ganglionic system of nerves. To its general character,
and the circumstances under which it is generated and in which it
operates in producing the disease, we have alluded in speaking of its
origin.</p>

<p>The predisposing causes are as numerous as the varied influences
which operate to depress the general health. The insalubrity of the
atmosphere may be regarded as a general, and, perhaps, the most
extensive predisposing cause. In this state, its vital element becomes
diminished or impaired to such an extent as to render it incapable of
sustaining the normal and healthy functions of the system in their
most vigorous condition. Hence, the foul and noisome air of close,
ill-ventilated apartments becomes very depressing and baneful; a direct
and effective element, often, in constant operation in generating and
producing the cholera, typhoid fever, or other deadly maladies. This
is not unfrequently the case on board some of our emigrant ships,
when hundreds of human <span class="pagenum"><a id="page36"></a>[p.36]</span> beings are stowed away between decks
without the means of efficient ventilation, disinfection, or other mode
of expelling the noxious principle. Though the germ of disease may be
ever on board, it does not vegetate and come forth and rapidly acquire
its activity, vigor and power, unless the localizing influence vivify,
foster and nurture its development. This is fully confirmed by the
recent arrival of two steamers with cholera on board.</p>

<p>The <i>England</i>, and a few days later the <i>Virginia</i>, with crews and
passengers all in perfect health, departing from a healthy port where
no cases of cholera were known to exist, and after being out at sea six
or eight days under the influence of a cool, invigorating atmosphere,
were surprised by the sudden irruption of cholera on board. It breaks
out among the steerage passengers who are crowded and packed together
between decks like sheep for the slaughter, in a confined atmosphere,
daily becoming more noisome, without the means of ventilation
or disinfection. Can any sane man <span class="pagenum"><a id="page37"></a>[p.37]</span> say the disease&mdash;the
cholera&mdash;was not here, on board these ships, generated and produced?</p>

<p>This is also confirmed by the occurrence of an isolated case on
Ninety-third Street, near Third Avenue, the first case in this city
this season. Though the cholera exists at Quarantine, the patient had
not been in any way exposed to the disease, except to the exhalations
from the overflowing and drainage of a privy and the foul atmosphere
arising from the cellar of her own tenement. On Monday, it is said, she
partook of her dinner, feeling a little indisposed; at 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
she called in her physician, and died the next morning, May 1st, at 11
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, in a state of collapse.</p>

<p>Take another instance: the second case in this city occurred in one
of the tenement dwellings of the Sixth Ward, No. 117 Mulberry Street.
The patient was a woman about thirty years of age, who had not been
exposed, except to the noisome atmosphere of her own dwelling and its
surroundings, which must be regarded, under the peculiar <span class="pagenum"><a id="page38"></a>[p.38]</span>
circumstances, as a true, genuine cholera atmosphere. In these cases
the evidence is conclusive that the disease was generated and produced
within, and on these premises.</p>

<p>The exhalations from low, moist, and marshy localities, from
the offensive cesspools, water-closets, sinks, sewers, and the
decomposition of animal and vegetable substances, from the refuse or
garbage which so often befouls the sidewalks and gutters of streets,
are all effective, predisposing causes, that directly facilitate the
production of the cholera. Whatever tends to depress the vital powers,
impair normal action, or relax in any degree the tone of the nervous
system, favors the operation of the final cause. So, too, the low,
underground, damp, unventilated apartments, the crowded and uncleanly
tenement houses, in which multitudes of the poorer class live, in a
confined, foul, and noisome atmosphere, not only favor, but actually
invite, the active operation of the infecting agent.</p>

<p>Habits of intemperance, profligacy, impurity, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page39"></a>[p.39]</span> and late hours,
have a powerful influence to depress and prepare the system for an
invasion of the disease in its most malignant form. In a neighborhood
of this description, when the cholera in 1832 was raging in the
adjacent city, from which it was separated by a very small creek, the
uncleanly multitude escaped entirely, not a case occurring there at
that time; but when, after an interval of several weeks, all danger
seemed to have passed, and the people were rejoicing and congratulating
themselves on their good fortune, the fearful disease suddenly appeared
in their midst with greatly intensified effect, and in a very few days
swept the place so clean that few were left to tell the sad story of
its ravages.</p>

<p>There are some other predisposing causes of no inconsiderable
influence, which not only favor the operation of the infecting agent in
the production of the disease, but even awaken its latent power, and
stimulate its activity and development in the system, once exposed to
its invasion. Among these, excessive fear of an attack, great anxiety
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40"></a>[p.40]</span> depression of mind, constitutional debility, deranged
condition of the digestive organs, accompanied with a relaxed state of
the bowels, exhaustion arising from fatigue or disease, semi-starvation
and unwholesome diet, neglect of personal and domestic cleanliness,
irregular habits, and excesses of every description, are all direct
incentives and stimulating agents in the production of the cholera. Any
one of these may be sufficient to induce an attack; but when a number
unite and act conjointly the danger is vastly greater, as the infecting
agent or disease-poison becomes thereby more intensified.</p>

<p>When the cholera first appeared in Europe and in this country in its
epidemic form, the majority of medical men, as well as the people,
believed it to be contagious, and to be propagated solely on this
principle. But when the disease appeared in 1848 a decided change
of opinion occurred, which led to a full discussion of the subject,
without any definite result; and the great question as to its
contagious character and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page41"></a>[p.41]</span> its mode of propagation remains still
unsettled. The higher authorities, says an eminent author, concurred in
the opinion of the Board of Health, "that the disease was not in any
way contagious, and that no danger was incurred by attendance on the
sick."</p>

<p>A large body of evidence, however, has been exhibited, going to show
that human intercourse has, at least, a share in the propagation of the
disease, and that it, under some circumstances, is the most important,
if not the sole means of effecting its diffusion. On the other hand, it
is affirmed that though it may be communicated, in some cases, by the
agency of human intercourse, it does not follow that the material cause
spreads by true contagion, that is, by reproducing itself in the bodies
of men, and there only.</p>

<p>The disease may be carried by healthy persons in their clothing, in
their ships, and in their caravans. That instances of this kind have
occurred there can be no question, for numerous records present some
undoubted <span class="pagenum"><a id="page42"></a>[p.42]</span> instances of the occasional communication of the
cholera-poison through human intercourse; still it is no less certain
that its general extension over the world cannot be accounted for on
this principle alone. "Its propagation by this means seems to be the
rare exception, its spread over the earth from other causes being the
common rule."</p>

<p>Dr. Hamlin, writing from Constantinople, in reference to the recent
irruption and prevalence of the cholera in that city, observes, "The
idea of contagion should be abandoned. All the missionaries who have
been most with the most malignant cases, day after day, are fully
convinced of the non-contagiousness of the cholera. The incipient
attacks which all have suffered from are to be attributed to great
fatigue, making the constitution liable to an attack."</p>

<p>It is a very singular fact, that the medical profession in India,
the birthplace and home of the cholera, almost universally reject
the doctrine of contagion. If those most observant and familiar with
its history, its <span class="pagenum"><a id="page43"></a>[p.43]</span> prevalence, and its annual recurrence as
an endemic disease, which they are called to treat in all its varied
phases, have discovered no contagious character by which it can be
propagated, it may be safely inferred that it is not contagious in the
common acceptation of the term, and that its extension over the earth
is governed by some other principle, and that the predisposing and
localized causes which are always in operation in India exercise no
small share in its diffusion, in directing its course, aggravating its
severity, increasing or diminishing its fatality, and determining the
duration of its prevalence in particular localities. When its infecting
germs have gained a lodgment in any city, section, or country, they may
be stimulated and become exceedingly active in the production of the
disease through these influences.</p>

<p>As to its introduction into different countries, it is quite evident
that the germ, or latent principle of the cholera-poison, exists in
such a state as to be capable of transportation, and may in this way be
diffused <span class="pagenum"><a id="page44"></a>[p.44]</span> to almost any extent when the localizing influences
are sufficient to develop its energies.</p>

<p>In this, as in all other zymotic diseases, some persons are more
susceptible of an impression and more liable to an attack than others.
Though no class can be considered exempt, yet there are some whose
organization, or innate protective principle, seems to render them
impervious to its influence. The cholera, however, is no respecter of
persons, or rank, or condition. The anæmic and cowardly in all ranks
and conditions are peculiarly liable, and are the most defenceless and
unresisting when invaded. In Europe, the probable numbers attacked in
that part of the world appear from statistics to be, in France, as 1
in 300; Russia, as 1 in 20; Austria, as 1 in 30; Poland, as 1 in 32;
Holland, as 1 in 144; Germany, as 1 in 700. "The circumstance of one
attack by no means protected the individual from a second in the same,
or any subsequent year; still a repetition of the disease in the same
person in the same year was rare."</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page45"></a>[p.45]</span> CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pathology.</span></h3>


<p>The doctrine now universally accepted and prevailing regarding its
Pathology is, that a poison, virulent, subtle, and unknown, has been
absorbed, and primarily infects the blood, so that, after a longer or
a shorter time, a primary disease of this vital fluid is produced, and
that the poison undergoes an enormous process of multiplication in
the living body of the cholera patient, as the direct result of this
morbific process so established, and that changes are induced in the
function of respiration directly consequent on this alteration of the
blood.</p>

<p>This altered condition and rapid change in the life-sustaining
principle of the blood, the loss of nerve-power, the impaired
circulation and tendency to congestion, are the proper and
distinguishing features of the disease; and the term "Algide," first
used by the French Pathologists, very happily <span class="pagenum"><a id="page46"></a>[p.46]</span> describes one
of the most remarkable and constant symptoms, namely, the diminution
of animal heat. The loss of temperature and its consequent effects
upon the circulation, depressing and prostrating the nervous power,
impairing and paralyzing the respiratory organs, suspending the
functions of the liver and kidneys, enfeebling the action of the heart,
and causing the capillary vessels of the mucous tissues to expand and
pour off the serous fluid from the blood and every muscle and tissue of
the system, with great rapidity, essentially constitute the phenomena
of the Cholera. The constantly increasing augmentation of the poison
and its intensified effects measure the malignity, the violence, and
the rapidity of the disease.</p>

<p>It is this multiplication, and the disturbance which attaches to it,
that in each case constitutes the disease and destroys life. Of this
fact the circumstantial evidence is abundant and conclusive, and may
account in part for the violence of the disease in its first irruption
in any particular locality. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page47"></a>[p.47]</span> The vomiting, purging, and cramps
are now generally considered as secondary and non-essential phenomena,
for numerous cases of cholera have occurred in every section where it
has prevailed in its more violent and malignant form without exhibiting
these symptoms. The poison was so potent, and its progress so rapid,
that life was extinguished in a very short time. In its first irruption
at Muscat, cases are reported in which only ten minutes elapsed from
the first apparent seizure before life was extinct. Dr. Milroy,
speaking of the violence and rapidity of the disease as it occurred in
1817, and again in 1845 and '6, at Kurrachee, observes, that "within
little more than five minutes hale and hearty men were seized, cramped,
collapsed, and dead." Instances of death taking place in two or three
hours are extremely common. When it broke out at Teheran, in May, 1846,
Dr. Milroy observes, that "those who were attacked dropped suddenly
down in a state of lethargy, and at the end of two or three hours
expired, without any convulsions or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page48"></a>[p.48]</span> vomitings, but from a
complete stagnation of the blood." In many places during its prevalence
in 1832, and subsequently in 1834, and in 1848 and '9, the rapid fatal
character of the earlier cases was observed and reported as the most
severe and hopeless. In various cities and villages in our own country,
cases of this description were not unfrequent. In all these the
destructive nature and rapid process of the disease was so depressing
and overwhelming as to prevent any effort of the "vis naturæ" to resist
its progress.</p>

<p>Hence, from the autopsy of those who have fallen victims to its baneful
influence in the first stage, or within forty-eight hours of the
attack, no alteration of structure in any organ or tissue has been
discovered. But in those cases where death has occurred at a later
period, some lesions and slight changes in the appearance of some
tissues have been traced. The more important of these, illustrative
of the characteristic effects of the disease, are, in brief, the
following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page49"></a>[p.49]</span> The follicular structure of the intestinal canal has been
found slightly swollen, and the intestine partially filled with a
turbid, inodorous, semi-diaphanous fluid, resembling thin starch,
or rice-water, and is supposed to be the remains of that peculiar
secretion which had taken place during life. This fluid is sometimes
acid, and sometimes alkaline. In the small intestines it is found in an
unmixed condition. It consists of two liquids of different consistency;
the one thick, the other thin. The latter constitutes the rice-water
stools, and may be passed off without admixture with the thicker
substance. The colon has been found generally much contracted, and the
mucous membrane and the sub-mucous cellular tissue of the digestive
canal presenting evident marks of congestion, in some cases approaching
to a sub-inflammatory state, generally in spots or patches of various
sizes, the color of these varying from a very dark congestion to a
more roseate hue. The glands of Brunner and Peyer, as well as the
solitary glands, are greatly enlarged. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page50"></a>[p.50]</span> The stomach and bowels
are frequently of a paler color than natural, both in their inner and
outer surfaces. The liver, the spleen, and the kidneys have been found
engorged with blood. The urinary bladder is always contracted, and
empty. The gall-ducts are sometimes contracted, at other times not.
The vena porta and all the other abdominal veins are loaded with black
blood, resembling tar in its color and consistency. The membranes of
the brain and cord are generally found congested, and the substance of
the brain more or less dotted with small points or specks of blood than
usual.</p>

<p>"The most common appearances in the lungs," says an eminent
pathologist, "are the presence of blood in the large vessels, chiefly
or solely; the collapse and the deficient crepitation arising from
the more or less complete absence of air and blood, and from the
approximation of the molecular parts of the pulmonary substance.
In other cases there is more blood in the minute structure, a
corresponding dark color of the lung, and a variable amount of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page51"></a>[p.51]</span>
frothy serum. The right side of the heart and the pulmonary arteries
were generally filled, and in some cases distended with blood; the left
side and aorta were generally empty, or contained only a very small
quantity of dark blood; the left side evidently had received little or
no blood, but had continued to contract, in some cases even violently,
on the last drop of blood which had entered it."</p>

<p>Such are some of the prominent appearances which the body has presented
when the patient has died in the first, or pulseless stage of the
disease. But in other cases, where the premonitory stage has been
definitely marked, and attended with diarrh&oelig;a or other depressing
disorder affecting the alimentary canal, and where the patient has
continued under the influence of the disease for a longer period, and
has passed through the usual successive stages of it, other additional
appearances have been noticed, which are here omitted, as they are of
a secondary importance, and belong especially to the more protracted
cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page52"></a>[p.52]</span> The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances, the phenomena of the disease,
the Algide, or diminished animal heat, and the loss of nervous power,
all tend to show an obstructed circulation and consequent embarrassment
of respiration resulting in the non-aeration and non-oxydation of the
blood, from which a long train of secondary and non-essential symptoms
arise. For it is affirmed that the mechanical part of respiration
remains in a good degree perfect, and that the heart evidently
continues to beat in many cases till stopped by the want of blood in
the left side and by its accumulation in the right side. Hence, for the
cause of this arrest of the circulation of the blood through the lungs,
we are forced to look to the condition of the blood itself, and the
deranged action of the ganglionic nerves.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to trace out from analysis the exact chemical
changes in the order of their occurrence which attend the period of
transudation from the blood into the intestinal canal. "The most
prominent phenomena of cholera," says Dr. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page53"></a>[p.53]</span> Aiken, "during this
period of transudation, consists in separation of the water and of the
salts of the intercellular fluid (of the blood) through the mucous
membrane of the intestinal canal, and the retention in the blood of an
important excess of albumen and of blood-cells, with apparently less,
but in reality with great diminution of the salts and fibrin."</p>

<p>"The inorganic constituents," continues the same author, "if compared
to the water, are during the first four hours increased, because at
this time the water is passing off with great rapidity; afterwards, as
the salts pass off, the disproportion is lessened, and after eighteen
hours or so, the proportion of salts is greatly diminished, and, if
compared with the organic constituents, the diminution is enormous.
With respect to the individual salts, there is in the blood a relative
preponderance of phosphates over chlorides, and of potash salts over
soda salts. By the end of eighteen hours or so, the blood-corpuscles
are left in a most abnormal condition; the great loss of water
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page54"></a>[p.54]</span> and of salts, especially of the chloride of potassium&mdash;a
most important constituent of the blood-cells&mdash;at once leads to the
conclusion that their functions must have been greatly impaired.
Accordingly, Dr. Schmidt found that the amount of oxygen contained
in them was lessened by one-half." Dr. Robertson affirms that the
"fibrin of the blood is usually in large amount and coagulable with
great firmness;" while Dr. Parkes, speaking of the same condition of
the blood, and relying on the accuracy of his analysis, observes, "The
presence of fibrin in the blood was not indicated by any coagulation
either in or out of the body; and whether coagulated or not, the
blood has usually a dark color; but it generally acquired an arterial
tint when brought into contact with the air in thin layers." * * *
"When we remember the great share taken by the blood-globules in the
respiratory and heat-furnishing processes, it is scarcely possible
to avoid concluding that their loss of salts is connected with the
characteristic cyanosis and lowered temperature <span class="pagenum"><a id="page55"></a>[p.55]</span> in cholera."
"The diarrh&oelig;a coincides with the first chemical changes in the
blood&mdash;the transudation of some of the constituents of the serum."
Hence the phenomena of the disease may thus be traced from this process
as the starting-point. All other chemical changes in the blood, and the
most marked symptoms, such as the abnormal respiratory process, follow
as a matter of course. Such is the theory of the nature of cholera, now
advanced and sustained by the most eminent pathologists, which embraces
the doctrine previously advanced that the blood is the primary seat of
the disease, and becomes contaminated by the absorption of a specific
poison.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Phenomena, or Symptoms.</span></h3>

<p>The attack of this fearful disease is most generally sudden, the
patient being at the time apparently unconscious of any depressing
influence, or derangement of the system. It is not unfrequent, however,
that some <span class="pagenum"><a id="page56"></a>[p.56]</span> slight irregularity of the bowels, loss of animation
and general vigor, or other apparently trifling indisposition,
have preceded it. In some instances there are definite and decided
premonitory symptoms which continue for a longer or shorter time
prior to the attack, commencing usually with a pallor or collapse of
the countenance, depression of spirits, slight pain in the forehead,
noise in the ears, occasional or transient turns of vertigo, slight
nausea, heat and pain in the epigastrium, oppression at the chest,
with frequent sighing, nervous agitation, some loss of muscular power,
general uneasiness, flatulence, with slight diarrh&oelig;a, sickness
at the stomach, occasional twinges of the nerves, or cramps in the
extremities, oppressed, small, feeble, and sometimes intermitting
pulse, coldness, clamminess, or humidity of the surface, and general
lethargy. Such are some of the premonitory symptoms which more
frequently occur in the lower latitudes, where the general vigor
becomes depressed by the long-continued and excessive heat of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page57"></a>[p.57]</span> climate. Their duration, whenever any of them do occur, varies
materially; sometimes one, two, or three days&mdash;sometimes longer but not
often.</p>

<p>According to the observations and descriptions given by those who have
had the best opportunities for becoming familiar with all its various
phases, the symptoms attending its invasion and general course are
too distinctly marked to be ever mistaken for any other disease. In
the minds of many who have been called to witness the developments of
cholera, they undoubtedly exist with such distinctness and vividness
as to render the most labored and accurate description tame. In this
treatise, however, a description of the leading and more prominent
phenomena will be given, and so far as a general principle of practice
is concerned, this might be very appropriately limited to its first or
cold stage.</p>

<p>The commencement of the disease is often so insidious as to pass
unnoticed till the system is fully prepared for the sudden and violent
attack. The slight, painless diarrh&oelig;a, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page58"></a>[p.58]</span> depression of the
nervous power, and occasional vertigo may all pass unheeded, and the
patient be apparently in perfect health. He may retire to rest entirely
unconscious of approaching danger, and after enjoying a sound and
undisturbed sleep for hours, be, on awakening from his slumbers, seized
with a remarkable sickness, perhaps vomiting, accompanied with most
remarkable and profuse discharges from the bowels. These inordinate
evacuations are usually attended with severe pains, extending down the
thighs, and a sense of complete and almost perfect exhaustion. The
physical powers and vital energies are immediately prostrated. The
temperature rapidly sinks below the normal standard&mdash;the body becomes
benumbed with an icy coldness&mdash;the skin becomes shriveled up, and
almost insensible to hot and stimulating fomentations&mdash;the breath,
too, as it comes from the lungs, appears to partake of the same icy
coldness, indicating the rapid elimination of heat, or caloric, from
the body. The patient complains of being greatly oppressed, throws
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page59"></a>[p.59]</span> off his clothing&mdash;calls for cold water, which he eagerly and
copiously drinks; though it afford no relief to his insatiate thirst,
it ought not to be withheld. This peculiar icy coldness and loss
of temperature is also further shown by the livid, blue, or purple
appearance of the hands and feet, extending sometimes over the greater
part of the body. The skin becomes, even in a few minutes after the
seizure, not only shriveled up, but often curiously wrinkled, as
in extreme old age. Severe spasms in the fingers, toes, legs, and
abdomen, cause the patient to groan and writhe under their influence,
and to call on his attendants, if fortunate enough to have any around
him, for aid and relief from his agonies. As the disease proceeds,
there may be noticed a peculiar, sharp and contracted state of the
features, and a wild and terrified expression of the countenance,
arising from the impression and fearful apprehension of rapidly
approaching dissolution. These important changes may all take place
in a very few minutes. To these most obvious <span class="pagenum"><a id="page60"></a>[p.60]</span> and singular
symptoms there is superadded constant vomiting&mdash;incessant purging&mdash;low,
feeble pulse, though occasionally natural and sometimes rapid, yet
in some instances, from the very first moment of attack, cannot be
discovered either in the large superficial arteries or at the wrist.
The voice is altered, becomes low, feeble, unnatural in tone, or sinks
even to a whisper. Respiration becomes quick, irregular, laborious
and imperfect. The inspiratory act being performed with difficulty,
and expiration being quick and convulsive. The flow of bile into
the intestines is suspended, the urinary secretion and micturition
entirely suppressed. Almost the only organ which seems to preserve
in any good degree its powers is the brain&mdash;the mental faculties in
some cases being retained till the close of life;&mdash;in other cases
feeble, weak, and much impaired. On the accession of the spasms, the
vomiting&mdash;and the purging&mdash;the disease may be considered as being fully
developed, and the crisis at hand, which, in a few hours, must decide
the fate of the patient. Its <span class="pagenum"><a id="page61"></a>[p.61]</span> progress is now rapid, and must
speedily terminate either favorably or unfavorably. If the result be
unfavorable, the patient may die with all these symptoms distinctly
and strongly marked. If the termination, however, be favorable, these
violent symptoms soon yield, and seem to be materially relieved;
yet, though these indications favor the return of normal power&mdash;the
weakness, the cessation of the pulse, the coldness and blueness of the
surface, and the sepulchral expression of the countenance, clearly show
that a few hours must close the scene. To many death thus often comes
calmly and quietly, without any struggle to mark the precise time of
this life's departure.</p>

<p>"If the patient," says an eminent author, "should happily survive
the cold stage, the disease may terminate by a rapid recovery, or it
may pass into the second or febrile stage." The former is the more
usual course in India, the latter in Europe. The first symptom of
returning health is shown by the patient falling into a sleep of
unusual soundness, during which the respiration becomes <span class="pagenum"><a id="page62"></a>[p.62]</span> light
and easy, the pulse freer, while a gentle, warm perspiration bedews
the whole body. This grateful pause in the disease appears to be the
result of the returning powers of life, uninfluenced by medicine, for
it often occurs where none has been given. After this balmy slumber the
patient awakes refreshed, and often recovers so rapidly, that in the
natives of India it almost resembles a restoration after syncope. In
all the Presidencies, indeed, and especially in Bengal, the recovery
of the European has, in general, been followed by a stage of reaction,
usually slight, but in some cases assuming the form of the bilious
remittent fever of the country, which has occasionally terminated
fatally. In most cases, however, the reaction is more considerable, and
the patient, in a few hours after the subsidence of the cold stage,
labors under a severe form of fever, resembling the typhoid. During
the first few hours after the febrile reaction commences the tongue is
white, but it quickly becomes brown and dry, while black sordes incrust
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page63"></a>[p.63]</span> the teeth and lips. The eye becomes deeply injected and red,
the cheek pale or flushed, the pulse rapid, and the temperature of the
body a little above the natural standard. The patient, either delirious
or comatose, then lies in a state resembling the last stage of the
severest typhoid fever of this country. This struggle usually lasts
from four to eight days, when the symptoms either gradually yield, or
death ensues. In a few mild cases the fever assumes an intermittent
type, or sometimes a quotidian, sometimes a tertian form: all these
cases usually recover. Such is, in brief, a summary of the more
important symptoms of the Epidemic, or Asiatic Cholera, especially in
its earlier or cold stage. The phenomena, especially developed in, and
belonging to, the stage of reaction, being of minor importance, they
have received only a very brief consideration; sufficient, however, to
show the general character and tendency of the disease in this stage of
its progress and termination.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page64"></a>[p.64]</span> CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;Unsuccessful Modes of Treatment&mdash;Venous Transfusion
Explained.</span></h3>


<p>In this discussion we shall avail ourselves of the researches and
investigations of eminent Professors, whose observations, experience,
and position give their views the highest authority. The latest and
most deserving record on this subject is from the pen of Professor
Aiken, of Edinburgh, who observes, "There are few diseases for the cure
of which so many different remedies and modes of treatment have been
employed as in Cholera, and, unfortunately, without our discovering an
antidote to the poison. In Moscow it is said that the mortality was
not greater among the destitute of medical aid than among those who
had every care and attention shown them. It may be fairly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page65"></a>[p.65]</span>
inferred, therefore, that in the severer forms of the disease, the
action of this poison is so potent as to render the constitution
insensible to the influence of our most powerful remedial agents. When,
however, the disease is mild, or on the decline, much may be done by
obviating symptoms to promote the recovery of the patient."</p>

<p>"The heroic remedies that have been employed in Cholera are bleeding,
and calomel and opium, either separately or conjointly. With respect
to bleeding, it may be stated, that in every country the patients
bore bleeding badly in any stage, and that the practice in Europe was
at length limited to a few leeches occasionally to the head. As to
calomel, that medicine was used to the greater part of an ounce in
the twenty-four hours, but with so little success that many patients
have been seized and have died under the full influence of mercury.
On the appearance of cholera in Europe, opium was administered in the
doses recommended by the Indian practitioners to the greater part even
of an ounce of laudanum; but it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page66"></a>[p.66]</span> was soon seen that in the
cold stage it was inefficient in controlling the vomiting or purging;
that it did not allay the spasms, and, moreover, hardly produced any
narcotic effect. The action of the accumulated doses of opium, however,
though suspended during the cold stage, was often fully developed in
the last stage, and occasioned so much affection of the head that
most practitioners either abandoned its use or limited it to a mere
fractional dose of that usually given in India, namely, from three to
twelve minims of the tincture of opium, or half a grain to a grain of
solid opium every four or six hours."</p>

<p>Let us now turn to a paper by the justly celebrated Professor Maclean,
whose observations and experiences have been more extensive than
perhaps those of any other professional gentleman either in Europe or
America. Unlike many of his brethren, he holds on this subject the
safer doctrines of practice, and very frankly and earnestly expresses
the same in the following language: "Opium in cholera should be
given <span class="pagenum"><a id="page67"></a>[p.67]</span> only in the premonitory diarrh&oelig;a. At this stage,
in combination with a stimulant, it is of the highest value. If
persevered in, particularly in the strong doses (justly reprobated),
it is a dangerous remedy, inducing fatal narcotism, or, at the least,
interfering with the functions of the kidneys, and so leading directly
to uræmic poisoning."</p>

<p>"Urgent thirst is one of the most distressing symptoms in cholera;
there is incessant craving for cold water, doubtless instinctive, to
correct the inspissated condition of the blood, due to the rapid escape
of the liquor sanguinis. It was formerly the practice to withhold
water&mdash;a practice as cruel as it is mischievous. Water in abundance,
pure and cold, should be given to the patient, and he should be
encouraged to drink it, even should a large portion of it be rejected
by the stomach; and when the purging has ceased, some may, with much
advantage, be thrown into the bowel from time to time.</p>

<p>In the stage of reaction, the fever may be moderated by cold sponging,
or by the wet <span class="pagenum"><a id="page68"></a>[p.68]</span> sheet; the secretion of urine may be promoted by
dry cupping over the loins by the use of chlorate of potash, and the
like. But suppression of this secretion is most to be dreaded where
opium has been too freely used in the treatment. In men of intemperate
habits, we often see, during the stage of reaction, obstinate vomiting
of thick, tenacious, green, paint-looking matter, probably bile
pigment, acted on by some acid in the stomach or alimentary canal.
It is a symptom of evil omen, and often goes on uncontrolled until
the patient dies exhausted, and this although all other symptoms may
promise a favorable issue. I have known it last for a week, resisting
all remedies, and proving fatal when the urinary secretion had been
restored and all cerebral symptoms had subsided. Alkalies in the
effervescing form, free stimulation of the surface, and chloroform
in small doses offer the best hope of relief. The patient should be
nourished more by the bowel than the stomach when vomiting is present.
Ice should be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page69"></a>[p.69]</span> not only to dissolve in the mouth, but to
swallow in pieces of convenient size."</p>

<p>"Another heroic plan," says Dr. Aiken, "peculiar, perhaps, to this
country, which was practiced when the inefficiency of medicines was
generally admitted, was an injection of a solution of half an ounce
of muriate of soda, and four scruples of sesquicarbonate of soda in
ten pints of water, of a temperature varying from 105 to 120 Fah.,
into the veins of the suffering patient. The solution was injected
slowly; half an hour being spent in the gradual introduction of the
ten pints, and the immediate effects of this treatment were very
striking. The good effects were rapid in proportion to the heat of the
solution, but a higher temperature than what is stated could not be
borne. After the introduction of a few ounces, the pulse, which had
ceased to be felt at the wrist, became perceptible, and the heat of
the body returned. By the time three or four pints had been injected
the pulse was good, the cramps had ceased, the body, that could not
be heated, had become <span class="pagenum"><a id="page70"></a>[p.70]</span> warm, and instead of cold exudation on
the surface, there was a general moisture; the voice, before hoarse
and almost extinct, was now natural, the hollowness of the eye, the
shrunken state of the features, the leaden hue of the face and body had
disappeared, the expression had become animated, the mind cheerful, the
restlessness and uneasy feelings had vanished, the vertigo and noises
of the ear, the sense of oppression at the precordia had given way to
comfortable feelings; the thirst, however urgent before the operation,
was assuaged, and the secretion of urine restored, though by no means
constantly so. But these promising appearances were not lasting; the
vomiting continued, the evacuations became more profuse, and the
patient soon relapsed into his former state, from which he might again
be aroused by a repetition of the injections; but the amendment was
transient, and the fatal period not long deferred. Of 156 patients thus
treated at Drummond Street Hospital, Edinburgh, under the direction
of Dr. Macintosh, only <span class="pagenum"><a id="page71"></a>[p.71]</span> 25 recovered; a lamentably small
proportion; and, small as it is, it seems doubtful if the recoveries
were final or complete."</p>

<hr/>

<p>But let us turn to another page, whose beauty is especially marred by
unreasonable expedients: "The warm bath," says the writer, "was at
first tried, but discontinued from the uncontrollable nature of the
vomiting and purging, and the oppressive sensation of heat it produced
on the patient's feelings. Mr. Dalton's vapor bath and Turkish baths in
the Hospital at Scutari have been used, but without benefit, and to the
disappointment of the hopes which had been entertained of them."</p>

<p>"Other methods of restoring warmth were had recourse to, such as
frictions with the hand or by the flesh-brush, or rubbing the body with
some strong stimulant embrocation, compounded of garlic, capsicum,
camphor, cantharides, or other powerful irritants. Mustard poultices
also were often applied to the feet and abdomen, blisters with or
without an addition of oil of turpentine, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page72"></a>[p.72]</span> the part having been
previously rubbed with hot sand; and in cases supposed to be urgent,
the mineral acids, and even boiling water, were employed for the
purpose of producing instant vesication."</p>

<p>"And, again, we read of those who tried to stimulate the waning powers
of life by galvanism, acupuncture of the heart, issues, setons, moxas,
actual cautery along the spine, and, lastly, by small pieces of linen
dipped in alcohol distributed over the body and then set fire to!!!"
Such are some of the means which have been used in the treatment and
cure of cholera.</p>

<p>"The failure of such powerful means at length caused most practitioners
to confine themselves to checking the diarrh&oelig;a, which so frequently
precedes cholera, and subsequently, to obviating symptoms as they
arose," and for this purpose, returned to and adopted a very simple
stimulating mixture, recommended by the Board of Health:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page74"></a>[p.74]</span> M.&mdash;&mdash;S.: ten drops every fifteen minutes, in a table-spoonful
of water. An opiate may be given with the first and second dose, but
should not be continued."</p>

<p>The learned author to whom we have referred, after detailing some of
the various expedients employed in the treatment and cure of cholera,
sums up the whole under the common term&mdash;failure&mdash;and, in effect,
declares the most powerful remedial agents ineffective and useless in
controlling and subduing this disease.</p>

<p>This declaration is made in reference to the general result of the
remedies and the various expedients adopted mainly by one class of
physicians, to which special reference has been made. It is therefore
partial, and confined solely to what is erroneously termed the regular
practice. In declaring all remedial agents a failure, does not the
author himself commit a greater failure in omitting to survey the whole
subject of treatment, and to trace out and to show from the application
of the pathology of the disease the probable cause of such failure?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page75"></a>[p.75]</span> However formidable this disease may appear, on account of
its rapidity and its firm, unyielding grasp upon the vital powers,
the forbidding and almost hopeless prospect of relief, and the
lamentable results which have attended some modes of treatment, it
seems particularly unfortunate for the profession that there should
have been a disposition on the part of this learned author to abandon
all remedial agents as comparatively useless, without a more thorough
investigation into the cause of failure. On this point no effort or
inquiry even is made. This is the more remarkable and surprising after
dwelling at length on the pathology of the disease. It would seem as if
all the light and science derived from this source for nearly half a
century had been overlooked, or the pathology of the disease, from some
cause not satisfactorily explained, had been deemed unworthy at least
in this instance to dictate the course of treatment. This should govern
in cases of cholera as in all other forms of disease, or else all our
efforts and remedies will prove <span class="pagenum"><a id="page76"></a>[p.76]</span> abortive. Now, had the doctor
carefully investigated the various modes of treatment and compared
the results of each, he might have come to a different conclusion.
But, being confined and limited in his investigations, he is unable
to discover anything reliable or worthy his commendation, except the
formulas above and the recommendation of Dr. Maclean. Among all the
remedies and expedients named, there is only one tending to fulfil,
the indications required, and that one, though prompt and magical in
its effects, has been unequivocally condemned, without looking beyond
the transient result for any light it might shed upon the subject. How
it should have escaped his notice and passed so long unobserved by the
numerous professional gentlemen who had often witnessed the effect, and
were anxiously searching for light and the means of affording relief to
the suffering patient, is a most singular circumstance which can only
be accounted for on the principle that they all were anticipating some
strange phenomenon, or development <span class="pagenum"><a id="page77"></a>[p.77]</span> of cure as mysterious as
the disease itself, which led them to overlook the simple and effective
means of relief so clearly represented and shown in their numerous
experiments for something more heroic and powerful than as yet the
imagination ever conceived.</p>

<p>If we trace the action of calomel, the use of opium, the effect of
cupping, bleeding, blistering, etc., etc., we shall obtain no very
desirable information; nothing valuable tending to indicate a correct
principle of practice. If we go still further, and examine the tendency
and effects of the various baths exhibited at Scutari, the use of the
flesh-brush, the bare hand, the heated sand, the embrocations, the
turpentine and other irritants, the boiling water, or the burning
alcohol, skinning and cooking the patient alive, we shall be shocked
at the enormous cruelty and barbarity that have been pursued, and
turn from the repulsive exhibition, without discovering one ray of
light to guide us in the right direction. Disappointed and baffled
in our inquiries, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page78"></a>[p.78]</span> shall we here abandon our investigations
and dismiss the whole subject, because our course is involved in
difficulties? Would intelligence and reason justify the neglect to
improve the means at command? We think not; but rather induce us to
advance in search of truth if the elements of success are not quite
exhausted. Let us be encouraged and stimulated to untiring perseverance
so long as there remains any experiment untraced and uninvestigated
in its bearing upon the direct action of the disease. Had Dr. Aiken,
or those other eminent surgeons who took part in those numberless
experiments, instituted on the Continent and in England, especially
those who initiated the process of injecting into the veins a solution
of soda raised to a temperature from 105° to 120° Fahr., continued
their investigations patiently and assiduously, they might probably
have discovered long ago the correct theory of practice for the
treatment and cure of cholera.</p>

<p>But they failed to see, or, if they saw at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page79"></a>[p.79]</span> all, rejected
the feeble ray of light struck out by the experiments in which they
had themselves participated, and like the celebrated Dr. Hunter,
who refused to listen to the discoveries made by his pupil, the
indefatigable Jenner, who traced the identity of the variola with the
common disease affecting the kine; and thence extracted the vaccine
lymph and established a principle by which that loathsome disease and
often recurring epidemic has been nearly banished from the earth.
Though they have thus failed, they have nevertheless left on record, in
unmistakable language, the result of their bold experiments, which we
may investigate, and appropriate the instruction drawn thence for our
own and the advantage of our fellow-men.</p>

<p>What, then, are these results, regarded as shedding light on this
intricate subject? We refer only to one the most obvious which we have
already cited above. Let us repeat and analyze, and, if practicable,
show the principle evolved. There was, on various occasions, the
solution of soda <span class="pagenum"><a id="page80"></a>[p.80]</span> injected into the veins at the temperature
from 105° to 120° Fahr.: a higher temperature could not be borne.
This process was performed slowly, thirty minutes being occupied
in injecting the ten pints. Now mark the result as the operation
proceeds. Says Dr. Aiken, "After the introduction of a few ounces, the
pulse, which had ceased to be felt at the wrist, became perceptible,
and the heat of the body returned." Mark the language: "only a few
ounces" were required to arrest for the time being, the progress of
the disease and restore warmth to the body; a very remarkable fact,
replete with instruction, as will appear as we proceed. Again says the
Dr., "by the time three or four pints had been injected the pulse was
<i>good</i>, the cramps had ceased, the body, that could not be heated,
had become warm, and instead of cold exudation on the surface, there
was a general moisture. The voice, before hoarse and almost extinct,
was now natural; the hollowness of the eye, the shrunken state of
the features, the leaden hue of the face and body had disappeared;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page81"></a>[p.81]</span> the expression had become animated, the mind cheerful, the
restlessness and uneasy feelings had vanished; the vertigo and noises
of the ear, the sense of oppression at the precordia, had given
way to comfortable feelings; the thirst, however urgent before the
operation, was assuaged, and the secretion of urine restored, though
by no means constantly so." Such is the astonishing result obtained
by this experiment, and this, too, when only three or four ounces had
been injected&mdash;all the urgent symptoms mitigated and relieved. What, we
ask, could have been more satisfactory, or better calculated to aid the
discovery of an important truth? Every distinctive and fatal symptom
for the time is relieved, and the normal condition and functions of
the system restored; a result which could only have been obtained by
the evolution of a principle of sufficient promptness and power and
diffusibility to arrest and utterly suspend for a time the force of
this disease.</p>

<p>What, then, was the principle evolved in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page82"></a>[p.82]</span> this experiment,
which gave immediate relief? Did it consist in the half ounce of
muriate of soda alone, or in the four scruples of sesquicarbonate
of soda alone, or in the ten pints of water alone, or in the whole
combined, or more especially in the high temperature to which the
solution was raised? It is a well-established fact that, in order
to raise the temperature of cold water to blood heat and above, a
large amount of free caloric must necessarily be absorbed, and exist
mechanically in the fluid; and, in this condition, the solution was
introduced into the veins, and there evolved its vast amount of free
caloric, which immediately permeated every organ of the system,
arresting disease, raising the temperature of the body, and restoring
its normal functions. Of this there can be little doubt. For free
caloric is one of the most prompt, effective and diffusive stimulants
known, and was evidently in this case the remedial agent which produced
the result. True, it may be said the effect was transitory, and passed
off as soon as the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page83"></a>[p.83]</span> caloric became eliminated. This, however,
cannot alter the nature, character, or influence of the principle on
which it was produced. It is usually admitted that a remedy that has
power to control disease, will, by its continued action and influence,
restore the normal condition of the system permanently, or at least
aid Nature to repair her own work. By this we would not be understood
as advising a repetition of the experiment under consideration, even
under the most urgent circumstances; far otherwise would be our advice.
We are arguing for the purpose of evolving and establishing a general
principle of practice.</p>

<p>The great question, then, is, Did the principle evolved fulfill the
indications required? and if so, is it available and consistent with
the pathology and the peculiar phenomena, or symptoms of the disease?
To settle this point, we need only turn to the law and the testimony,
the very highest authority on the subject. The doctrine now universally
accepted and prevailing regarding its pathology is, that a poison,
virulent, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page84"></a>[p.84]</span> subtle, and unknown, has been absorbed and
infects the blood, so that, after a longer or shorter time, a primary
disease of this vital fluid is produced, by which the vital energy is
impaired, and all other morbific changes induced. The term "Algide,"
first used by the French Pathologists, very accurately describes one
of the most remarkable and constant symptoms, viz., the diminution
of animal heat. On this depend the altered condition of the blood,
the depression of the nervous power, the impaired functions of the
respiratory and all the vital organs which are essentially involved
by the disease. The icy coldness of the surface, the breath, the
extremities and general loss of temperature, all show the character of
the disease and the wants of the system.</p>

<p>Did, then, the principle evolved accord with the pathology and
phenomena of disease? And did it fulfill the indications required? If
not, we ask by what means was the disease arrested, and all the urgent
symptoms mitigated and relieved, or by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page85"></a>[p.85]</span> what were the good
effects produced, and the normal action for a time restored? Can the
result be reasonably accounted for on any other principle than the one
assigned&mdash;the stimulating power of the free caloric? We think not; for
it accords most perfectly with the pathology and the peculiar phenomena
of the disease. It assuaged the more urgent symptoms, answered the
imperious demand of the waning powers, revivified and reinvigorated
the vital energies, and restored for the time the normal tone of
the system. What more could be desired in any single agent than the
result here obtained? That it accomplished all this, there can be no
question, according to the statement of the learned professors who have
repeatedly witnessed and described the results.</p>

<p>The question, however, will arise, Can this principle be rendered
available? Most certainly it can; and though it may not be convenient
to introduce free caloric into the stomach, we can, by combination,
introduce a stimulant of equal potency which shall be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page86"></a>[p.86]</span> equally
as prompt, effective and diffusive in its action, similar in its
influence, and similar in its results. It is the principle&mdash;not the
precise element for which we contend.</p>

<p>It is universally admitted that in many instances we may learn much
from observing the manner of death which, in a majority of these cases
of cholera, may be described by the term asthenia&mdash;a death similar to
that which occurs in congestive fevers, and in some cases of accidental
poisoning. Perhaps the most striking fact observed in these cases is
the perfect exhaustion attending the last moments of existence, and
the quiet, undisturbed manner in which life terminates. This very
clearly shows the exhausting nature and congestive character of the
disease, and gives us an idea of the course of treatment necessary to
be pursued. If, then, there is anything to be learned from this source
relative to its treatment, it does most certainly corroborate and
strengthen the position we have here taken.</p>

<p>Another feature of the case in aid of our <span class="pagenum"><a id="page87"></a>[p.87]</span> position consists
in its entire accordance with the modes of treatment which have been
most successful in the cure of cholera. The two formulas cited above,
and now most universally adopted in Europe and India, are based on a
similar principle. So in this country 1832,-33 and 34, the successful
modes of treatment consisted in the adoption of a principle essentially
similar. Hence we infer from the teachings of this experiment, and from
all the collateral facts on the subject, that the general principle to
be observed in the treatment of this disease is a prompt and diffusive
stimulant; and hence we deduce the doctrine already apparent, that
every form of treatment, to be successful, must be based on a prompt
and effective stimulant of sufficient power to meet as speedily the
indications required, as did the free caloric in the experiment to
which we have referred.</p>

<p>Here we might pause for a moment and examine the suggestion and
doctrines advanced by the learned Drs. Bell, Johnson, and many other
eminent practitioners in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page88"></a>[p.88]</span> India and Europe. We might further
investigate the principles and trace the practical philosophy of such
eminent surgeons, as Drs. Mackintosh, Thompson, Wallis Maxwell, Massy,
Hill and Brady, all of whom have had opportunity of investigating the
nature and character of the disease and extensive experience in its
treatment.</p>

<p>We might also, in a further examination of the subject, embrace a host
of American authors whose works teem with every shade of doctrine,
and almost every variety and description of practice, some evincing
a degree of skepticism on the subject more wonderful and marvelous
than is becoming the great apostles of medicine. It would seem as
if the guiding light of science and experience had forsaken them in
this, the hour of their need; that facts and arguments had failed
to illumine their minds, or direct their inquiries in the proper
course for the discovery of "the truth." Their conclusions on this
subject are, therefore, marvelously inconsistent and conflicting. Over
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page89"></a>[p.89]</span> this mass of specious and conflicting testimony we might
long ponder, without deriving any very valuable information worthy an
elaborate effort, or making any discovery to aid in the establishment
of a general principle of practice for the cure of cholera. But this
investigation must be deferred to another occasion, when time may
permit a more thorough and critical examination of their doctrines and
practice than can be presented in this brief essay. We would, however,
remark in passing, that in some instances their philosophy, doctrines,
and results may lead us to the same conclusion to which we have arrived
from other sources as above, and from our regard and belief in the
progress of science, feel compelled to advocate the same, as offering
the best hope of success in the treatment of this disease.</p>

<p>In the employment of an anti-miasmatic principle and remedial agent,
we feel ourselves abundantly sustained, by the concurrent testimony,
of those English surgeons connected with the Medical Bureau in the
department <span class="pagenum"><a id="page90"></a>[p.90]</span> of India, whose numerous experiments and carefully
detailed clinic cases occurring in the recent irruption and prevalence
of the disease in that section, exhibit its utility in such a striking
contrast with all former practice, as to leave no doubt as to its
direct and specific action in the cure of cholera. It is in allusion to
these experiments, and in answer to the question, what is deemed the
most successful mode of treatment, that the learned Professor Maclean
unhesitatingly observes, "Alkalies in the effervescing form, free
stimulation of the surface, and chloroform in small doses, offer the
best hope of relief." As this opinion comes from such high authority,
and is compatible with the pathology of the disease, we may, without
fear of controversy, add in conclusion, in any and every form of
medication for the cure of cholera, we must not forget that chloroform
is our sheet-anchor; and must be so combined and administered as to
meet promptly the indications required.</p>


<h3 class="lihei1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page91"></a>[p.91]</span> <span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;Physiological Condition of the Blood.</span><br/>

<span class="ftsize65">ITS NON-AERATION&mdash;NON-OXYDATION.</span></h3>

<p>In the preceding section we alluded to the suggestions and doctrines
advanced by the learned Dr. C. W. Bell, Physician to the Manchester
Infirmary, and late Physician to H. M. Embassy in Persia&mdash;and also
to Dr. George Johnson, of Kings College, whose views and doctrines,
relative to the Pathology, illustrative of the congestive character
and non-aeration of the blood, coincide with those of Dr. Bell. A
brief examination of their philosophy and doctrines will show very
conclusively the first direct impression of the poison&mdash;the gradually
altered condition of the blood, and the corresponding loss of nerve
power&mdash;the impeded arterial circulation and the general tendency to
congestion, as well as the altered condition and stagnation of the
blood, especially during the stage of collapse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page92"></a>[p.92]</span> The question is asked, "What is the pathological explanation
of this remarkable train of symptoms?" and the answer is given, "The
one great central fact is this, that during the stage of collapse, the
passage of blood through the lungs, from the right to the left side of
the heart, is in a greater or less degree impeded." Very conclusive
evidence as to the existence of impeded pulmonary circulation
during life is afforded by the appearances observed in the heart,
blood-vessels, and lungs after death.</p>

<p>After adducing the evidence of this impediment from <i>post-mortem</i>
examinations, and affirming that the blood does not flow freely
through the lungs and pulmonary arteries, which are often filled and
much distended with blood, it is observed&mdash;"The most interesting and
conclusive evidence that arrest of blood in the lungs is the true key
to the pathology of choleraic collapse, is to be found in the simple
yet complete explanation which it affords of all the most striking
chemical phenomena of the disease, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page93"></a>[p.93]</span> the imperfect aeration of
the blood, and the suppression of bile and urine."</p>

<p>And again, says the learned author, "It is obvious that the stream of
blood from the pulmonary capillaries to the left side of the heart
is the channel by which the supply of oxygen is introduced into the
system. One necessary consequence, then, of a great diminution in the
volume of blood transmitted to the left side of the heart must be,
that the supply of oxygen is lessened in a corresponding degree. This
position, probably, will not be disputed by any one who will give the
subject a moment's consideration. Nor, again, can it be denied or
doubted that certain results must of necessity follow this limited
supply of oxygen." * * *</p>

<p>"The blood in cholera is black and thick only during the stage of
collapse; in other words, during the stage of pulmonary obstruction and
defective aeration."</p>

<p>Again, in his explanation of the injection of the solution of soda
into the veins of the suffering patient, it is affirmed, "The benefit,
however, is of but short duration, for the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page94"></a>[p.94]</span> primary cause of
the impeded circulation, namely, the poisoned condition of the blood,
being still in operation, * * * the stream of blood through the lungs
will soon again be obstructed, and the patient thus passes into a
state of collapse as profound as, and more hopeless than, before. It
appears, therefore, that the hot saline injection into the veins and
the operation of venesection, when it rapidly relieves, as it often has
done, the symptoms of collapse, have this effect in common, that they
facilitate the passage of the blood through the lungs, and thus lessen
that embarrassment of the pulmonary circulation which is the essential
cause of choleraic collapse. But whereas the <i>hot injections act</i> by
removing the impediment which results from spasmodic contraction of the
arteries; <i>venesection acts</i> by relieving over-distension of the right
cavities of the heart, and thus increasing the contractile power of
their walls."</p>

<p>Such are, in brief, the views of the learned Drs. Johnson and Bell,
whose works are very highly commended by their American <span class="pagenum"><a id="page95"></a>[p.95]</span> editor
to the notice of the profession. These views, coming as they do from
the highest authority, fully sustain the doctrine that the earliest
impression of the disease is made upon the blood, and hence it becomes
altered and changed in its most essential life-sustaining principle;
for its oxygen becomes diminished, its consistency augmented, and its
flow through the lungs impeded. Through this channel the effect of
the poison soon makes an impression on the ganglionic mechanism, and
the nerve-power becomes correspondingly diminished, and the action
of the ganglionic nerves essentially deranged. But this is not all:
they exhibit in the clearest manner the congestive character of the
disease, and show the necessity of prompt and decided means to arrest
this tendency. Hence, they urge, in the strongest terms, the importance
of observing carefully this essential feature, and endeavor to exhibit
fully the condition of this vital fluid at a particular stage of the
disease, when bleeding, as recommended in their practice, is required,
and may be performed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page96"></a>[p.96]</span> to the best advantage for the relief
of the partially congested blood-vessels, and to stimulate and give
freedom to the circulation. The passage of the blood, they affirm, is
impeded, clogged, and partially suspended. To remove this obstruction,
relieve spasm, and secure the prompt aeration of the blood, in hope
of arresting the progress of this disease, is ostensibly the object.
However, they seem studiously to avoid the most logical conclusions of
their explanations, and justify a practice that can give no hope of
permanent relief, while every fact and symptom is ominously suggestive
of the wants of the system, which imperiously demands the aid of
electrified oxygen, ozone, or free caloric, for the oxydation of the
blood.</p>

<p>Says Dr. Reid, "I believe the true explanation of the arrest of blood
in the lungs to be this: The blood contains a poison, whose irritant
action upon the muscular tissue is shown by the painful cramps which it
occasions. The blood thus poisoned excites contraction of the muscular
walls of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page97"></a>[p.97]</span> minute pulmonary arteries, the effect of which is
to diminish, and, in fatal cases, entirely to arrest the flow of blood
through the lungs."</p>

<p>Says Dr. Wallis, "The phenomena which are exhibited when the
deleterious air has been drawn into the lungs are these: the great
gastro-pulmonary nerve is either wholly or partially paralyzed; the
consequences are the cessation of all its functions, either wholly or
partially. This great nerve is a nerve of function, and performs the
functions of digestion and respiration, and influences all secretions."</p>

<p>Dr. Maxwell, of Calcutta, uses the following language: "The development
of the stages of fever entirely depends on the changes the <i>leaven
has effected</i>. If this change has been such that the blood has become
too thick to flow through the lungs, then, as a matter of course,
the collapse stage is developed in excess; in other words, <i>cholera
asphyxia</i> is exhibited. The blood, unable to pass through the middle
passage into the arteries, collects and swells out the veins, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page98"></a>[p.98]</span>
giving that deadly or blue color to the skin. When the vomiting and
spasms come on, this mass of blood in the veins is squeezed with great
force, and hence the clammy moisture that is forced from every part
during these fits. There is no pulse, because there is no blood in the
arteries." "There are also lethargy and languor, and oppression in
breathing, caused by the blood being collected in the veins. These make
up the principal links in the chain of mechanical symptoms."</p>

<p>Dr. Bell, dwelling on this congestive character of the blood, and
endeavoring to point out the best mode of relief, observes, "When this
has reached to such a point as to oppress the action of the heart,
yawning first and then shivering, or a sense of suffocation and pain
in the precordia, are the indications of oppressed circulation, and of
the commencing effort of the heart to overcome the mass of blood which
is stifling it. If, by the application of tourniquets to the limbs, or
by <i>bleeding</i>, part of the blood which is rushing from the extremities
to increase <span class="pagenum"><a id="page99"></a>[p.99]</span> this congestion is prevented from reaching the
great veins, the heart, excited to increased action, is enabled, by
this relief, more quickly to overcome the obstruction and restore the
balance of the circulation, and the paroxysm passes off. If not thus
mechanically aided, the heart, after a severe struggle to maintain the
circulation during the period of constriction, is at length relieved
by this nervous disturbance or spasm of the capillary circulation
passing off of itself, and then the heart and arteries, so long excited
by the struggle, maintain for a time their increased action after
the obstruction in the capillaries is removed, and produce apparent
febrile action. Presently this excitement subsides, the vessels become
relaxed, and sweat succeeds. The vessels continue in this state for
a longer or shorter period, according to circumstances, till they at
length recover their ordinary tone and action in the intermission. This
fever, however, is not fever properly so called, but reaction; and the
sweating not critical, or essential, but relaxation. The cold stage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100"></a>[p.100]</span> is alone essential, and is the physiological cause of the
subsequent stages."</p>

<p>From the passages we have cited, it is quite evident that Drs. Johnson,
Bell, Parkes, Reid, Wallis, Maxwell, Massy, and many others, admit this
congestive character and impeded circulation of the blood to be the
result, or consequent of a primary affection of the blood, as we have
already observed in a former paper. The <i>term</i> "Algide" is peculiarly
expressive of the diminished animal heat, and, as Dr. Bell represents,
it is the cold stage which is alone essential, and is the physiological
cause of the subsequent stages. It is the specific disease-poison,
so often referred to, that has been inhaled, the leaven that has
effected such obvious changes in the blood. The poison, virulent, and
subtle, and unknown, so marvelously active in its operations, that
is exhibited so prominently in all the works we have perused as the
one great, mysterious, and efficient cause which produces the disease
called cholera, and all the phenomena of its development. To its direct
and specific <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101"></a>[p.101]</span> action, therefore, must be attributed all the
phenomena of the disease as the resulting subsequent consequences.</p>

<p>It is also further evident, from the pathological facts and arguments
adduced in support of this theory of congestion, that the abnormal
condition or state of the blood-vessels is the result and the product
of the activity of the primary or final cause, and must be regarded
in relation to it as cause and effect. On this principle alone, the
thickening of the blood, the contraction of the left ventricle of the
heart, and of the capillary and pulmonary arteries, assigned by some as
the cause of choleraic collapse, must be accounted for. These effects
are not and cannot be from a process independent and outside of the
primary disease action, but are the result of such primary action.</p>

<p>Again, it is evident, from the views and doctrines cited above, that
the disease is decidedly congestive in its tendency and character
from its very commencement. The impeded flow of the blood&mdash;the
comparative <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102"></a>[p.102]</span> emptiness of the left ventricle of the heart
and arteries&mdash;and the excessive loss of temperature, all indicate a
rapid process of congestion attending the progress of disease. This
is one of the peculiar and prominent features of cholera, and is
strikingly exhibited in the morbid appearances observed in all those
instances where death has occurred within a few minutes from the first
indications of attack.</p>

<p>When the attack is violent, the process is rapid; when mild, it is
slow; and even in the collapse stage progresses tardily. In either case
it is the direct resulting consequent of the primary cause. How else
can the violent attacks, suddenly terminating in death, be accounted
for? To what other principle can this altered condition and stagnation
of the blood be attributed? The evidence confirmatory of this position
is abundant and conclusive. Many instances of the apparently rapid
action of the cholera poison are related by Dr. Milroy, in a historical
sketch of the epidemic of 1817; and at Kurrachee in 1855 and 6,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103"></a>[p.103]</span> it is said, that within little more than five minutes, hale
and hearty men are seized, cramped, collapsed, and dead!!</p>

<p>When the disease broke out at Teheran, in May, 1846, Dr. Milroy states
that those who were attacked dropped suddenly down in a state of
lethargy, and at the end of two or three hours expired, without any
convulsions or vomitings, but from a complete stagnation of the blood.</p>

<p>In the paper before us, it is stated, that "in a great majority of
cases in which death has occurred during the stage of collapse, the
right side of the heart and the pulmonary arteries are filled, and
sometimes distended with blood; the auricle being partially, and the
ventricle completely and firmly contracted. The tissue of the lungs is,
in most cases, of pale color, dense in texture, and contains less than
the usual amount of blood and air. There is something surprising in
the contrast between the almost constant occurrence of this extremely
anæmic condition of the lung, from which scarcely even a few drops
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104"></a>[p.104]</span> of blood flow when the tissue is cut, and the hyperæmia of
most of the other viscera." This impeded flow of the blood through the
lungs, resulting, as it must, in a very scanty supply of blood to the
arteries, in connection with the corresponding fact of the increased
expansion of the veins, filled with black, and thick, and stagnant
blood which, by the action of a powerful poison, or malignant disease,
has become disorganized and unfitted for circulation, furnishes
indubitable evidence of one prominent and characteristic feature of
cholera which we term congestion, and to which we alluded in our
remarks when the question under consideration was first introduced;
in this view we are happy to find ourselves, on a more thorough
examination of the subject, ably sustained by eminent pathologists
and authors, who have arisen during the half century last past, and
whose works are said to embrace all that is known and reliable on the
character and treatment of Epidemic Cholera.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice, before passing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105"></a>[p.105]</span> from this part of our
subject, that according to Dr. Bell's <i>views</i>, the blood is forcibly
sent into the great central veins, and there stopped in its course
without any attempt to account satisfactorily for its singular arrest,
at that point&mdash;Dr. Johnson comes to his relief, lifts the veil, and
explains why it is kept there and cannot get any further. If the road,
he tells us, had been clear and uninterrupted through the lungs, the
blood would easily have got round to the left ventricle, and have again
gone its round, but it is stopped by the spasmodic contraction of the
minute branches of the pulmonary artery, which will not even allow the
blood to enter the pulmonary capillaries, as shown by the remarkable
anæmia of the texture of the lungs.</p>

<p>In this connection may be introduced an opinion as to the cause of
the disease and some of its phenomena, which has obtained at least
some celebrity, and attracted the attention, if not the careful
consideration of the profession. It will account, in part, if founded
in fact, for the physiological condition under consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page106"></a>[p.106]</span> It is said, some have observed a chemical change in the
constitution of the atmosphere, and have attributed the cause of the
cholera to the loss or diminution of its ozone&mdash;a principle which
is understood to represent what is very properly termed electrified
oxygen. Ozone is, therefore, the vital element of the air. It is said
that oxygen cannot be assimilated or combined with the blood except
when it is in an electrified state constituting the peculiar property
or state of ozone. In this state it produces vital electricity of the
blood, <i>which is the life</i>. The brain is considered and represented
as the reservoir of this vital electricity, and the nerves are the
telegraphic wires or conductors of it. As a necessary consequence, all
acts of material and intellectual life depend upon this double cause.
The absence, then, it is affirmed, of this principle, termed ozone&mdash;or
electrified oxygen&mdash;from the atmospheric air in certain localities
and the consequent non-aeration or non-oxydation of the blood, may be
considered as an efficient cause which will <span class="pagenum"><a id="page107"></a>[p.107]</span> account for some
of the most striking phenomena of the cholera.</p>

<p>Whether this electrified oxygen, or ozone, is identical with free
caloric, it is unnecessary for our purpose at present to determine. It
will be admitted that oxygen is the source of animal heat, and when
introduced into the system generates its free caloric, which is an
essential life-sustaining principle.</p>

<p>Dr. Massy, after describing a severe and advanced stage of cholera,
observes, "The treatment of this case depends in the first instance
on bleeding, and largely, if the patient's pulse is good, giving at
the same time twenty grains of calomel with one of opium. This, he
thinks, will be found the best practice. After twenty minutes, he gives
ten grains more of calomel and half a grain of opium. He considers,
however, a reliance on opium in this form of cholera most faulty&mdash;but
observes, as you draw blood, stimulate, give punch, brandy, or wine and
water, or carbonate of ammonia. Apply friction, with stimulating and
hot liniments to the extremities, warm sand-bags to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108"></a>[p.108]</span> feet,
sinapisms to the calves of the legs and pit of the stomach; for, if
you can once raise the pulse, the chances in favor of recovery will be
vastly increased." The practice of bleeding and stimulating at the same
time is deemed of vast importance. Dr. Bell coincides in this view, and
devotes much space to the necessary instruction as to the time when and
under what circumstances to bleed and to what extent, endeavoring to
show the advantages arising from a strict observance of certain rules
in carrying out this practice.</p>

<p>We have thus traced, <i>in extenso</i>, the views and doctrines of eminent
surgeons and authors on the changes of the blood, and especially of
the impeded circulation, to show, if practicable, the inconsistency of
the more common and prevailing practice, and its utter inadaptation
to the pathology and phenomena of disease. On the latter there seems
to be little or no discrepancy&mdash;on the former there is a great
diversity&mdash;as there has been no general principle established and
laid down as the basis <span class="pagenum"><a id="page109"></a>[p.109]</span> of treatment and cure of cholera.
It has often been observed there is no disease on which so many
different modes of practice have prevailed, some purely experimental,
others empirical&mdash;and all without discovering an antidote to the
poison, or any efficient mode of relief. The cause, or the poison
producing the disease, still remains undiscovered. The direct mode
of suspending and removing it, or counteracting its power and
neutralizing its effect, and subsequently eliminating <i>it</i> from the
system, remains still in doubt. What course, then, should the epidemic
cholera again prevail in our midst, shall we pursue? Shall we rest
satisfied with the diversified modes of treatment now prevailing? Or
guided by the light of reason, science and experience, endeavor to
adopt a general principle of practice, and exhibit and establish an
efficient and judicious system, consistent with the pathology and
the phenomena of the disease? Does then the practice, the prominent
features of which are given above, accord with the indications
required? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page110"></a>[p.110]</span> In short, does the exhibition of bleeding and
calomel and opium, accompanied with sinapisms, and hot, stimulating
applications to the surface, meet the pathological condition and
the phenomena of the disease? We have seen that the rapid changes
in the blood, and the consequent direct tendency to congestion, are
the proper and distinguishing features of the disease;&mdash;and hence
the diminution of animal heat and general loss of temperature and
their consequent effect, impeding the circulation, depressing and
prostrating the nervous power&mdash;impairing and paralyzing the respiratory
organs&mdash;suspending the functions of the liver and kidneys&mdash;enfeebling
the action of the heart, and causing the capillary vessels of the
mucous surfaces to pour off the serous fluid from the blood, and every
muscle and tissue of the system with great rapidity, essentially
constitute the phenomena of the cholera;&mdash;and that the constantly
increasing augmentation of the poison and its intensified effects,
measure the malignity, the violence, and the rapidity of the disease.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page111"></a>[p.111]</span> Is there, then, any tendency in bleeding to arrest this rapid
process of disease so disorganizing, depreciating, and enfeebling to
the vital life-sustaining fluid, the blood? Can abstracting a portion
of it, however large, suspend the poison, or its activity, or even
check its progress in its rapid course and fatal termination? Can it
have, under its depressing and depleting process, any tendency or
power to relieve the congestion that is taking place, or change in any
good degree the poisonous principle which is now generally admitted
to exist in the blood, and to be the sole and efficient cause of its
altered character and condition? The poison, once introduced into the
blood, like the leaven hid in three measures of meal, will continue its
activity, increasing its energy, and multiplying its forces, till the
whole circulation becomes affected, and its life-sustaining power is
destroyed and utterly lost, unless, by the exhibition of some remedial
agent, it shall be promptly arrested in its progress, and suspended
and eliminated. Again we ask, Will calomel fulfill <span class="pagenum"><a id="page112"></a>[p.112]</span> any of
the indications required? Has it any influence or power to arrest this
disease, to quiet the nervous system, relieve the cramps, or restore
warmth to the body? Its specific action, so far as known, can have no
tendency whatever to relieve the system in any essential particular,
or stay the progress of disease, or delay its inevitable result, if it
remain unsubdued by the action of other remedies. Its action upon the
liver, however prompt it may be, is only of a secondary importance. The
primary cause must be overcome, its activity and energy suspended and
the system generally relieved, or there is little hope in the case.</p>

<p>Here we may ask, Will opium aid, or give the relief so urgently
demanded? However serviceable as an astringent and anodyne in the
premonitory stage of the disease, it cannot be exhibited in the second
stage to so good an advantage, as its direct influence is to aid and
promote congestion in those cases, where a tendency of this kind is
already in existence. Hence, its continuance in the true or collapse
stage <span class="pagenum"><a id="page113"></a>[p.113]</span> of cholera is now generally considered faulty.</p>

<p>Once more: The auxiliaries employed in aid of the leading remedies
already noticed may be summed up in the language of the celebrated
Dr. Massy, in his instructions and directions on the subject of the
treatment now under consideration. He observes, "But, as you draw
blood, stimulate, give punch, brandy, or wine and water, or carbonate
of ammonia. Apply friction, with stimulating and hot liniments to the
extremities; warm sand-bags to the feet, sinapisms to the calves of the
legs and pit of the stomach; for, if you can once raise the pulse, the
chances in favor of recovery will be vastly increased."</p>

<p>To these directions there can be no special objections, except in the
first instance in which he, indirectly, commends the use of means
tending to deplete and depress the system, already brought by disease
to the very verge of utter exhaustion. Remedies of this tendency
are contra-indicated, and cannot, to say the least, be employed to
advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page114"></a>[p.114]</span> Depressing remedies generally, instead of checking, or
counteracting the disease, will inevitably aid and hasten its fatal
termination. Stimulants, such as are prompt and diffusive in their
character, must be regarded as essential, and may be employed to great
advantage. It will be found, however, exceedingly difficult in most
cases, even where there is no depletion from bleeding, to keep up the
waning powers, and carry the patient, through this formidable disease,
to a favorable termination. Of the utility of warm applications to the
surface generally, there can be no question; yet, our main reliance is
on internal remedies, as has been already shown: the lost temperature
of the body must be restored, the production and diffusion of heat, or
caloric, must be internal through the administration of remedies, that
will promptly and kindly produce this result.</p>

<p>What are, then, the remedies? We have ventured in this discussion to
recommend the internal use of chloroform, and believe it will be found
in combination with other <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115"></a>[p.115]</span> prompt and diffusive stimulants,
specially adapted to meet this condition. In this recommendation, we
feel ourselves fully sustained by the result of various experiments
heretofore made, and the recent trials of its use, as an internal
remedy in the various stages of the disease.</p>

<p>The earliest record of the use of chloroform in cholera is probably
to be found in the London <i>Lancet</i> for November, 1848, in which Dr.
Hill reports a case of its successful use by inhalation. He placed
the patient in bed, covered with warm blankets, and applied friction,
stimulant liniments, and heated bags of bran to the surface, and kept
the patient under the gentle influence of chloroform, till the more
urgent symptoms entirely subsided. At intervals brandy-and-water, and
thin arrow-root or milk was given. All other medicines were avoided.
Though the urgent symptoms returned at first, as the effects of the
chloroform passed off, they were easily controlled by the repetition
of the inhalation. By persevering in its use, reaction set in, and the
patient became convalescent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page116"></a>[p.116]</span> Other cases, afterwards, were treated in the same way, with a
similar result. Some, however, required the gentle use of chloroform
by inhalation, at intervals, for twenty-four hours; after which, none
seems to have been administered. For aught that appears these cases all
recovered.</p>

<p>Another very interesting case is related by Mr. Brady, who observes
that an elderly lady was seized with slight diarrh&oelig;a, which, on
the following morning, had become very profuse: excessive vomiting
supervened, accompanied by spasms in the calves of the legs, fingers
and toes. Under these urgent symptoms, the usual remedy, brandy, was
administered without avail; the dejections became incessant, and the
spasms increased in intensity, presenting the features of a decided
case of malignant cholera. In this condition, the physician was called
in haste, as it was believed and affirmed the patient was dying. In
describing this case, the physician observes: "On my arrival, I found
the patient presenting all the symptoms of malignant Asiatic cholera,
in an <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117"></a>[p.117]</span> advanced stage; the features collapsed and ghastly;
extremities and tongue cold; burning sensation in the stomach and
&oelig;sophagus; pulse rapid and scarcely perceptible; voice diminished
to a whisper; stomach exceedingly irritable, and the dejections from
the bowels presenting the characteristic rice-water appearance; and
all the voluntary muscles of the body were affected by spasm, so that
the patient actually writhed in agony." Ordered the following: &#8478;.
Chloroform &#658; j; Ol. Terebinth. &#8485; j; aq. Dist. &#658; iij. M.
And gave immediately a large tea-spoonful, in a wine-glass, of dilute
brandy; and applied sinapisms to the calves of the legs and abdominal
and thoracic surfaces. Thirst was relieved by drinking plentifully of
water nearly cold. Though the stomach was irritable, the chloroform was
retained, as well as the fluid drank after it, and was followed by no
dejection. Half an hour after, two pills were administered, composed
according to the following: &#8478;. Calomel gr. v; fellis. bov. inspis.
gr. x; Ft. Pil. ij. Half an hour after these <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118"></a>[p.118]</span> were given,
vomiting ensued, but soon subsided; the diarrh&oelig;a had apparently
ceased; the cramps had diminished in frequency and severity. A second
dose of chloroform, now one hour after the first, was administered, and
soon after this two more of the pills, both of which were retained,
and gave decided relief. The pulse rose in power and became slower,
the spasms less frequent, and, in an hour after the second dose, the
patient was bathed from head to foot in a warm perspiration, and
expressed herself comparatively free from all uneasy sensations. The
attack had been completely subdued, leaving behind a good deal of
pyrexia and debility, from which she rapidly recovered.</p>

<p>Here it is worthy of notice, that in this case, severe as it was, only
two doses of the chloroform mixture were administered, each containing
about six minims of chloroform and forty of turpentine; the pills
would naturally tend to perpetuate rather than relieve the nausea and
vomiting, and in one hour after the administration of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119"></a>[p.119]</span>
second dose, all the urgent symptoms were assuaged.</p>

<p>In another case, the attending physician reports that, after giving
calomel, combined with opium, which was immediately rejected,
the following mixture was ordered: &#8478;. Chloroform vj minims;
brandy &#658; iij; water &#8485; iijss, one-third of which was given
immediately, and was thrown up in half an hour; a second dose was then
given, and was retained. The vomiting and diarrh&oelig;a ceased; the
spasms became less severe. In two hours after, gave the remaining third
part; and during the next six hours, administered in two doses six
minims more of the chloroform, with the most decided benefit, and the
patient soon became convalescent. To the extreme tenderness over the
region of the epigastrium flannel soaked in spirits of turpentine was
applied; and as no urine was secreted, I am firmly of the opinion that
the usual remedies would not have met this case. "I candidly confess,"
says the physician, "I had no hope of success from its severity; and,
but for a knowledge <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120"></a>[p.120]</span> of Mr. Brady's case, I believe I should
have lost my patient."</p>

<p>Dr. Davies reports a case in which he used chloroform fifteen hours
after the seizure with relief, but not with success, and observes that,
in a number of cases occurring in the hospital, there were 22 cases in
which, as severe symptoms came on, the chief remedy was chloroform,
administered internally, in doses of from seven to ten minims every
hour, half hour, or quarter of an hour, according to the severity of
the symptoms. Of these 22 cases, 8 terminated fatally, and 14 recovered.</p>

<p>Again: "Out of 9 cases of cholera, and 13 of the worst cases of
diarrh&oelig;a occurring in my own practice, and treated with chloroform,
<i>one died</i>. All these were in the better ranks of life. In some of
them, the warm bath (salt water) was used as an auxiliary, and the
diet consisted of nothing but cold milk and water, with some carbonate
of soda, <i>ad libitum</i>. The fatal case was that of a drunkard, who,
probably, did not take the remedy. These cases varied in severity,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121"></a>[p.121]</span> from sickness and diarrh&oelig;a, and mild collapse, to
sickness, diarrh&oelig;a, severe cramps, and great collapse, with almost
clear watery evacuations, passing away involuntarily * * * Of 14 cases
of cholera treated by Mr. Towers, Medical Resident of the Infirmary,
many of them under my own observation, <i>one died</i>. The fatal case was
that of a woman aged 63, who was previously suffering great depression,
consequent on extreme destitution."</p>

<p>Again, says Dr. Davies, "It will probably be remembered that, in my
second report, I expressed a very favorable opinion of chloroform in
this deadly malady. I considered I had strong grounds for so doing,
after observing the large proportion of cases which recovered under
its administration. From the history of this last visitation in the
county prison, however, the fact turns out, that, under some uncertain
circumstances, the use of chloroform will not prevent the proportion
of deaths being considerable. I have reason to believe that it was,
from over-anxiety, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122"></a>[p.122]</span> given in too frequent doses in some
cases, and that it thus rather added to the coma, which is one of the
characteristics of the malady.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the outbreak, the doses were repeated every
hour, or every two hours, and it is to be noted that the first seven
cases <i>recovered</i>.</p>

<p>As the cases multiplied, the remedy was given every half hour, and, in
some instances, every quarter of an hour; the result was that the next
six cases died. Whether these cases had anything in them inherently
more fatal, it is difficult to tell. The symptoms at first were about
equal, and the differences did not show themselves until towards the
end. There was next a recovery of seven cases in succession; in these
the remedy was administered less frequently, but subsequently two
deaths occurred under the less frequent administration.</p>

<p>The chloroform was administered also by inhalation, in some of the more
severe cases of cramps, with the effect of affording relief in every
instance. The inhalation was not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123"></a>[p.123]</span> carried so far as to produce
insensibility. Although I am still of the opinion that chloroform
properly regulated is the remedy of all others hitherto tried to be
depended on, yet it cannot be considered a specific for cholera."</p>

<p>Mr. Steadman reports a very interesting case treated by chloroform.
He observes, "The spasms were universal and extremely violent, as if
knots were being tied in the bowels, countenance livid and cold, voice
feeble, and all medicines rejected. In this condition gave chloroform
combined with 'aquæ vitæ' and distilled water. The first dose had
a partial but most satisfactory effect. In two hours after, as the
symptoms manifested a disposition to return, gave a second dose, which
entirely controlled all spasms, vomiting and purging. The patient was
ordered cold rice and mucilaginous drinks, and had the chalk mixture
with nitric ether prescribed. A dose of oxgall (gr. x) was given in
course of the day, which produced the desired effect. In two days the
patient was declared convalescent." <span class="pagenum"><a id="page124"></a>[p.124]</span> The daughter, who had
nursed the mother in this case, was seized soon after in a similar
manner, except the dejections were more abundant and frequent. The
mother having some of the chloroform mixture left, gave it to the
daughter without advice or hesitancy, and obtained the same magic
results. The first dose was only partial in its effect, but the second
completely subdued the disease.</p>

<p>Such are the results of some of the experiments which have been made
by the administration of chloroform; and, so far as appears, the first
cases treated by inhalation were severe malignant cholera in the
advanced stage, all of which recovered. So, also, those treated by the
remedy used internally, combined with a prompt and decided stimulant
like the spirits of turpentine, or aquæ vitæ and brandy, recovered.
In all these cases the remedy appeared to meet the urgent demand, to
remove the impediment to the circulation, to relieve the nausea and
vomiting, and purging and cramps, and restore, in a very short time,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125"></a>[p.125]</span> the general action and normal tone of the system. Still we
must admit, that some cases, treated by its internal administration,
and also by inhalation, proved, on some accounts not satisfactorily
explained, unsuccessful. Were these cases given in detail, it would be
much easier to detect the cause of failure, or its questionable use in
such cases; but we have only the bare fact that they were thus treated,
without the manner or character of the combination, if any were made,
being given.</p>

<p>Hence Dr. Davies, under whose direction these cases occurred,
remarks, in view of this result, "that <i>no reliance</i> could be placed
on chloroform alone." The correctness of this opinion cannot be
questioned, for the experiments we have cited all show the necessity
of a prompt and diffusive stimulant in aid of its action, to render it
sufficiently prompt and powerful to meet and overcome the disease in
the more rapid and severe cases. Chloroform, properly combined, offers
the best hope of relief, and is, without doubt, the most perfectly
adapted of any <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126"></a>[p.126]</span> remedy known to the pathology and phenomena
of the disease. There is no remedy, when properly combined, so capable
of meeting all the indications required as this, and none that can be
administered with more certainty of success.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we may, with much propriety, refer again to the
pathology suggested by the authors cited above, and inquire whether
the action of chloroform as a remedy in these cases be consistent?
and whether as such it has that curative influence, or direct
controlling power, to arrest, suspend, and cure the disease, so
imperiously demanded? We have seen that, according to the opinion
generally prevailing, the first impression of the poison is made upon
the blood, and through it upon the nerves, especially those which,
from their anatomical position, bear the most intimate relation to
the blood-vessels. Through this channel the first invasion appears to
be made on the ganglionic, the nerves of circulation. These nerves
are distributed chiefly to the viscera and blood-vessels, and are at
least very <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127"></a>[p.127]</span> early involved and essentially disturbed, for
their healthful action depends in no small degree on the aeration or
oxydation of the blood. Says an eminent author, "The action of every
ganglionic mechanism depends on the existence of certain physical
conditions, among which the most prominent and important is the due
supply of arterialized blood. If this be stopped but for a moment the
nerve mechanism loses its power, or, if diminished, the display of its
characteristic phenomena correspondingly declines." Hence the loss
of power in these nerves, and their deranged action, the contraction
of the capillary and pulmonary arteries, the impaired and impeded
circulation and all the phenomena arising therefrom.</p>

<p>Again, the great pneumogastric nerve, which is composed of both motor
and sensitive filaments, has a very extensive distribution in the
upper part of the abdominal cavity. It supplies the organs of voice
and respiration with motor and sensitive fibres, and the pharynx,
&oelig;sophagus, stomach and heart with motor influence. This very
important <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128"></a>[p.128]</span> nerve, through the primary action and deteriorating
process of the cholera poison, becomes early involved, and its
functions greatly, and, in fatal cases, permanently deranged. The
evidence of this disturbance and loss of nerve-power is too obvious to
be overlooked or disregarded in the treatment of this disease.</p>

<p>In confirmation of this, we may, with great propriety, adduce the
testimony of Dr. Wallis on the loss of nerve-power, and the process
through which the result is produced, who observes, that "the phenomena
which are exhibited when the deleterious air has been drawn into the
lungs are these: the great gastro-pulmonary nerve is either wholly or
partially paralyzed, the consequences are the cessation of all its
functions either wholly or partially. This great nerve is a nerve of
function, and performs the functions of digestion and respiration, and
influences all secretions."</p>

<p>Hence it appears the nervous power generally, as before observed, is
very early and essentially impaired, and to such an extent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129"></a>[p.129]</span>
that there can be no rational hope of relief, unless some remedial
agent can be found that will exercise such a controlling influence and
power, as shall be adequate to restore the tone of the nervous system.</p>

<p>Hence, we are forced to the conclusion that the prominent, leading,
and most urgent symptoms requiring special attention, are "the Algide"
or loss of temperature, the loss of nerve-power in the ganglionic and
pneumogastric nerves and their branches, the altered or disorganized
condition of the blood, the impaired or obstructed circulation, and
the early and direct tendency to congestion. These are the prominent
and essential features to be observed in the treatment. They are too
intimate, dependent and inseparable, to warrant any attempt to mark the
precise order of their development. They are the essential phenomena,
proceeding equally and directly together from the primary cause and
disease action, and strictly constitute the complex character of the
cholera, and exhibit its main, distinguishing features, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130"></a>[p.130]</span> which
must necessarily govern and dictate the maxims of rational practice in
the treatment of this disease. The object, then, of first importance
is to restore the lost temperature, the caloric already eliminated,
and prevent its further depression; to restore, at the same time,
the lost nerve-power to the nerves again; to arrest the process of
disorganization of the blood, and equalize the circulation; to relieve
and suspend the congestion; and then, according to all the experiments
which have been made, the consequent and dependent phenomena of the
cramps and the vomiting and the purging will disappear.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Section III.&mdash;Different Modes of Treatment.</span></h3>

<p>After speaking of the various expedients resorted to for the cure of
cholera, says Dr. Watson: "I believe that each, in some cases, did
good, or <i>seemed</i> to do so; but I cannot doubt that some of them did
sometimes do harm. I had not more than six <span class="pagenum"><a id="page131"></a>[p.131]</span> severe cases
under my own charge, and I congratulated myself that the mortality
among them was not greater than the average mortality. Three died, and
three, I will not say were cured, but recovered, * * * under large and
repeated doses of calomel. Yet, as I said before, I do not venture
to affirm that the calomel cured them." It seems that Dr. Latham
commenced the treatment and Dr. Watson followed it up, repeating the
half-drachm doses of calomel many times, as the patients seemed to
rally after its administration. Again, he observes: "It was remarked
of those who recovered, that some got well rapidly and at once, while
others fell into a state of continued fever, which frequently proved
fatal, some time after the violent and peculiar symptoms ceased.
Some, after the vomiting and purging and cramps had departed, died
comatose&mdash;<i>over-drugged</i>&mdash;sometimes, it is to be feared, by opium. The
rude discipline to which they were subjected might account for some
of the cases of fever." * * * "Never, certainly, was the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132"></a>[p.132]</span>
artillery of medicine more vigorously plied, never were her troops,
regular and volunteer, more meritoriously active. To many patients,
no doubt, this busy interference made all the difference between life
and death. But if the balance could be fairly struck and the exact
truth ascertained, I question whether we should find that the aggregate
mortality from cholera in this country was any way disturbed by our
craft."</p>

<p>In a report by the acting physician to the Bellevue Hospital, made to
then "Special Medical Council," August 2d, 1832, while the Epidemic
Cholera was still prevailing there and in the city, the physician
says: "The treatment I have divided into two kinds&mdash;the pathological
and the mixed. The first having been determined on, after the careful
examination of twenty-three persons dead of cholera; since then, ten
more have been examined, which serve to confirm the conclusions first
formed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pathological Treatment</span>.&mdash;<i>First Stage</i>&mdash;This consisted in the
administration of blue <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133"></a>[p.133]</span> pill and opium with absolute diet. If
pain was present, leeches to the epigastrium and arms, and when these
could not be procured, cups to the epigastrium. This plan never failed
to arrest the disease in the hands of those who diligently pursued
it, where the mucous membrane of the gastrointestinal canal was not
previously diseased.</p>

<p><i>Second Stage.</i>&mdash;First, Blood-letting; second, diligent frictions
with the ointment alluded to above, when persons could be procured to
perform the duty; third, ice to allay the thirst; fourth, small doses
of brandy and laudanum, if the vomiting continues; fifth, cups to the
epigastrium, if there was pain and the brandy omitted.</p>

<p><i>Third Stage.</i>&mdash;First, ice to allay the thirst, which is now, indeed,
unquenchable; second, external heat; third, a continuation of the
frictions; fourth, no opium, and, frequently, no brandy, especially
among the children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mixed Treatment</span>&mdash;<i>First Stage.</i>&mdash;Besides the above treatment,
calomel and Dover's powders was a very frequent prescription; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134"></a>[p.134]</span>
also scruple doses of calomel, and calomel and opium in small doses,
and all with success. Nevertheless, I believe they occasionally did
harm.</p>

<p><i>Second Stage.</i>&mdash;First, blood-letting less frequent than above; second,
calomel and Dover's powders continued; third, calomel and opium;
fourth, calomel, capsicum and opium; fifth, soda powders; sixth,
scruple doses of calomel every half hour; seventh, ice.</p>

<p><i>Third Stage.</i>&mdash;Calomel and Dover's powder; calomel and opium; calomel,
capsicum and opium; carbonate of ammonia and capsicum; scruple doses
of calomel every half hour. External heat in various ways; ice, etc.
Severe shocks of electricity along the course of the muscles to allay
the cramps; also, the burning of alcohol on the skin. The first was the
practice of Dr. Devan, the second, that of Dr. Gardner, and both lay
claims to having been the first to use these means."</p>

<p>The ointment alluded to above is composed of mercurial ointment, one
pound, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page135"></a>[p.135]</span> camphor finely pulverized, seven ounces, and the
same quantity of capsicum. With this, the patient was rubbed briskly
from head to foot and repeated at short intervals. The result was,
that mercury generally showed its specific effects upon the gums in
from five to ten hours from the commencement of reaction. The success
of this external application of mercury, conjoined with its internal
administration and frequent blood-letting, may be learned from the
cholera statistics of this and other institutions.</p>

<p>Dr. Pereira employed sixty-grain doses of calomel, it is said, with
success, and Dr. Barton of New Orleans, in 1849, gave in ten cases from
120 to 150 and even to 180 grains of calomel at a dose, and, in one
case, gave 220 grains, intending, it is said, to have weight sufficient
to keep it down. This brave and heroic practice did not afford relief
in a single instance; the cramps, and vomiting, and purging continued,
and a few hours closed the scene&mdash;all died.</p>

<p>The treatment recommended in the American Practice of Medicine, by Dr.
W. Beach, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page136"></a>[p.136]</span> which was fully tested by the author himself while
in discharge of his official duties as physician of the Tenth Ward,
city of New York, during the prevalence of cholera in 1832, is worthy
of consideration on account of its simplicity, its great efficiency and
wonderful success. "Among all the medicines," says the author, "ever
given or proposed in the incipient or premonitory stage, none will
be found so efficacious as our neutralizing mixture, made of genuine
materials and given very strong. Occasionally, it may be proper to add
fifteen or twenty drops of laudanum; this, however, is very seldom
necessary. A vast number of medicines are recommended in this stage
of cholera, but there are none, I am convinced, so efficacious as the
above."</p>

<p>In the second, or confirmed stage, the same medicine was continued in
larger and more frequent doses, with hot fomentations to the abdomen,
stimulating lotions, sinapisms and injections. The cholera drops were
also administered, composed according to the following formula:</p>

<p>Give a tea-spoonful every hour or half hour, according to the severity
of the symptoms.</p>

<p>In the third, or collapsed stage, he directed a tea-spoonful of
pulverized black pepper to be mixed and given in a tumblerful of hot
gin-sling; also, the same to be prepared and applied hot to the bowels
and extremities. Also, to two tea-spoonfuls of either pulverized red
or black pepper, pour on a sufficient quantity of hot water, let it
stand till nearly cold; strain and inject the whole up the bowel. This
would often arouse the patient in the collapsed stage when there was
little or no hope of recovery. Such are in brief the remedies which
were used so successfully in the Tenth Ward of this city, in 1832.
Here it will be noticed that the general principal evolved in this
treatment consists in its prompt <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138"></a>[p.138]</span> and diffusive stimulant, its
antispasmodic and corrective power so combined as to act gently and
kindly, yet promptly and successfully, as the records show, to which we
shall refer in the sequel.</p>

<p>Another mode worthy of a passing notice is one analogous to this,
adopted and recommended by the eminent Dr. G. S. Hawthorne, of
Liverpool, England, who observes: "Of the medicinal remedies, the chief
is opium. This, I have explained, should be given in combination with
medicines of a cordial, stimulating and antispasmodic character, of
which the most efficient are camphor, capsicum, ether and aromatic
spirits of ammonia. The following formulæ present the combination of
the medicines which I would prefer:"</p>

<p>"Cholera," observes Dr. H., "presents itself in four distinct degrees
of malignity. All the modifications of the disease require to be
treated on the same principles, the only difference being that, in the
detail, the milder forms require less powerful doses of the medicines.
The mode of treating the most malignant form of the disease, will
serve as a model on which all the others are to be treated. This
most malignant form has, by all writers on the subject hitherto,
been pronounced incurable. They say it never was cured in a single
instance, and never can be cured by the power of medicine. I shall,
however, point out a mode of treating it which will prove itself
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page140"></a>[p.140]</span> infallibly successful where my directions are followed with
sufficient promptness, boldness and skill." In detailing the mode of
procedure, the doctor observes: "Place the patient immediately in the
horizontal posture in bed, and give him on the instant, as this is
an extreme case, ten of the antispasmodic pills, and two ounces of
the antispasmodic mixture, and wash the whole down with a glass of
undiluted brandy or whisky, flavored strongly with cloves, essence
of ginger, or some such warm aromatic spice. In the mean time, have
him covered with an additional blanket, and let the usual means of
communicating heat, such as jars or bottles of hot water, bags of hot
salt or sand, hot bricks, or whatever can be most readily procured,
be applied without delay to the feet and different parts of the body,
so as to restore the temperature and produce perspiration as quickly
as possible. As soon as the perspiration has begun to flow freely,
superadded to the medicines and cordials already administered, a glass
of brandy-punch should be given, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page141"></a>[p.141]</span> punch to be made strong
and to be swallowed hot as possible. After this, no drink should be
given until the perspiration has flowed freely for a few minutes. The
stomach will then retain it, and the patient should be indulged freely
with copious draughts of rennet whey, warm toast-water, flavored with
some agreeable spice, mint, or balm-tea, or any such mild beverage. The
necessity of attending to this is most important. When the discharges
from the bowels cease, and when the pulse becomes full and bounding,
the body is covered with a copious, warm perspiration, which will not
fail to be the case under such treatment; the danger is over. The
perspiration, if the patient can bear it, should be kept up for twelve
hours, and may, with advantage, be continued moderately even longer.
Its duration, however, must be regulated according to the strength of
the patient and the state of the pulse. After the first four or six
hours, more heat need not be applied than is perfectly agreeable to the
feelings of the patient. It is remarkable how suddenly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142"></a>[p.142]</span> the
precordial oppression, etc., are relieved on the breaking out of a free
perspiration, and, what is of greater importance still, the vomiting,
where it exists, immediately ceases." In short, all the urgent symptoms
soon subside, and the patient becomes convalescent.</p>

<p>Such is Dr. Hawthorne's treatment, which is affirmed to have been
invariably successful. It is based on the same general principle as the
preceding&mdash;a prompt and diffusive stimulant. Here we might ask, What
constitutes the chief reliance in the formulæ? Was it the opium that so
promptly met and arrested the disease? or the combination of the other
powerful stimulants with which it was united? Dr. H. places his main
reliance on this drug, and yet affirms that it produced no narcotism or
other sensible effect whatever, except as a diaphoretic, and even in
this its influence may be questioned. The prognosis becomes favorable
from the fact of a sudden rise in the temperature of the body, for the
icy-coldness disappeared, the heat of the surface <span class="pagenum"><a id="page143"></a>[p.143]</span> returned,
the circulation was equalized and a profuse perspiration set in, and,
as these conditions appeared, the urgent symptoms subsided. Not the
excessive doses of opium, but the remedies in combination as a whole,
produced by its prompt stimulating power these results, and the patient
was thus relieved.</p>

<p>Mr. Forward, while superintending some of the public works in the
State of Kentucky, in 1832, had in his employ more than two hundred
laborers, among whom the Cholera Epidemic of that year appeared about
a week before its irruption in Louisville. The first case was that
of a young, sober, industrious white laborer, who was at the time
vigorous and apparently healthy. It was a sudden and severe case and
occurred about eleven o'clock at night. The physicians who usually
attended these men were at a distance, and could not be obtained
without considerable delay. Under these circumstances, Mr. Forward,
after visiting the patient, becoming acquainted with the symptoms,
and believing it a genuine <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144"></a>[p.144]</span> case of cholera, commenced
treatment at once, fearing, as he states, the patient could not live
till a physician could be obtained. It was, indeed, a desperate case;
violent spasms, with constant vomiting and severe purging, attended
with that livid appearance and peculiar coldness so characteristic of
the disease. "Of the treatment," says Mr. Forward, "I gave him first a
quick, stimulating emetic prepared from the lobelia seed, which checked
the vomiting and purging, but had little effect upon the spasms. I
then applied the steam bath, having his feet and legs at the same time
immersed in water as warm as he could bear, which was made strong with
salt and wood ashes. I then sweetened a tumbler of warm water and put
into it a tea-spoonful of "number six," and about the fourth part of
a tea-spoonful of Cayenne pepper, and gave him one-third of it when
I commenced sweating him, and the balance at intervals while he was
sweating. By the time he had been sweated ten minutes, he was free from
spasms and pain, but I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page145"></a>[p.145]</span> continued the sweating ten or fifteen
minutes longer, then wiped dry, after which the patient laid down and
went to sleep&mdash;being thus relieved and cured."</p>

<p>Another case of a colored man who was strictly temperate and healthful
occurred an hour or two later the same night. His attack, too, was
sudden, and still more severe; cramps very violent, vomiting and
purging equally as severe, though he had not been awakened from his
slumbers more than fifteen minutes. This case was treated the same
as the former, with the emetic, sweating, and when the sweating had
subsided, administered a table-spoonful of spirits of turpentine, which
relieved him entirely, and he soon went to sleep. The next morning
both were comfortable, and went to work and remained well. During the
prevalence of cholera at that time, Mr. Forward had thirteen cases in
his own family, and, on one day when the epidemic was at its height,
seven cases among the laborers. All these and many others that occurred
were treated in the same manner, with the same undeviating <span class="pagenum"><a id="page146"></a>[p.146]</span>
success. Not a single instance of death from cholera in his own family,
or among the hands on the road. When the epidemic cholera reappeared in
1835, the same course of treatment was pursued, with the same uniform
success. Such results, considering the malignant character of the
disease, are truly astonishing. Whatever may be said of the general
principle of practice in these cases, its success must be admitted
as equaling, if not surpassing, the treatment of any equal number of
cases on record. Though conducted by an unpretending and unprofessional
gentleman, yet, out of the whole number attacked during the continuance
of the epidemic, not a single case was lost.</p>

<p>In a report of a case of cholera treated successfully by rectified oil
of turpentine, administered internally as a specific, by Richard Brown,
Esq., Surgeon, Cobham, Surrey, November, 1848, it is stated that the
patient, "aged fourteen, having suffered from severe bowel complaint,
presented all the symptoms of cholera in the stage of collapse.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page147"></a>[p.147]</span> The bowels acted incessantly, and anything taken into the
stomach was immediately rejected; the pain around the umbilicus was
intense, attended with severe cramps of the legs; the pulse exceedingly
small, and scarcely perceptible; tongue coated in the centre, and
flabby; the surface of the body much below the natural standard; the
countenance of a blue cast, and expressive of the greatest anxiety. So
decided, indeed, was the symptom that the case was considered almost
without hope." "But I had determined," says the physician "to treat
the first case of cholera that occurred in my practice with rectified
oil of turpentine, given internally, the active principle of which,
camphogen, possesses stimulating, diuretic, diaphoretic, sedative,
antispasmodic, antiputrescent properties. I administered immediately
one drachm of it combined with mucilage and aromatics, directing it to
be repeated every two hours, the patient to be kept warm and to take
meal broth with excess of salt."</p>

<p>Now mark the result of this simple, uncombined <span class="pagenum"><a id="page148"></a>[p.148]</span> remedy. In
the evening of the same day all the urgent symptoms were assuaged, the
purging and vomiting had ceased, the pulse was raised, the surface
of the body had become warm and moist with perspiration, the pain
around the umbilicus diminished, and the cramps less violent, but the
countenance still bore the appearance of great anxiety. Such were the
immediate results of the administration of this remedy, which appear,
from the subsequent history of the case, to have been permanent and
unattended with any constitutional derangement, or other serious and
unpleasant effect. On the morning of the next day the patient was
steadily improving; much of the anxiety of countenance had vanished,
but the pain in the belly and cramps of the legs still remained, though
much relieved. On the second morning after the attack the patient was
very much better; no pain in the belly, and does not feel sick from
the turpentine. On the third morning the patient was up, and, though
exceedingly weak, there was no trace of any alarming symptom remaining.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page149"></a>[p.149]</span> The bowels had moved from the effects of a previous dose of
calomel (two grains) given the next morning after the attack, and the
evacuation was much more healthful. A mild tonic and alterative plan
of treatment was all that was necessary to restore the patient to her
usual health, and she is now well. The remedy was given at first every
two hours, then every four, and lastly every six hours. This treatment
commenced on the 26th and terminated on the morning of the 29th. Its
duration about sixty hours, when the patient is declared convalescent
and comparatively well. Here we might ask, What experiment with any
single remedy has been more important and satisfactory in indicating
and directly pointing out a general principle of practice for the
successful treatment and cure of this formidable disease? We say single
remedy, for it is doubtful whether the two grains of calomel exercised
any curative influence whatever, or in any way varied the result. It
is, therefore, to the use of the rectified oil of turpentine that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page150"></a>[p.150]</span> the favorable termination and cure of the disease is to be
attributed.</p>

<p>There is another mode of practice which has been exhibited to some
extent in almost every part of the world, claiming to be more
efficacious and successful than any other in the cure of epidemic
cholera. It is the general principle which is the great and important
consideration with which we are concerned in presenting it among the
various modes adopted for the cure of this disease. This is found
clearly defined and ably presented by Dr. Joslin in his lecture on
cholera, in which, after exhibiting the views and doctrines governing
the practice, and contrasting its results with those of other modes,
he observes, in relation to the treatment of cholera in its early
stages, that "whatever may be the form of attack, give one drop of the
tincture of camphor dropped on a lump of sugar, and then dissolved in
a table-spoonful of cold water. Repeat this every five minutes until
there is a decided mitigation of the symptoms. This will usually be
after five or six doses. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page151"></a>[p.151]</span> If the disease be taken in time, ten
or twelve doses are ordinarily sufficient. There is abundant testimony
of the efficacy of this camphor treatment from all parts of Europe."
Again, speaking of the first variety, in which the most prominent
symptom is diarrh&oelig;a, the Dr. observes, "If camphor does not soon
give relief, we are to resort to phosphorus, or to phosphoric acid. Dr.
Quinn has employed both with equal success. Phosphoric acid is to be
preferred when there is a gluey matter on the tongue. In some cases,
veratrum, chamomilla, mercurius, or secale may be indicated. However,
phosphorus and phosphoric acid rarely fail to cure; and some high
authorities are in favor of giving one of them at first, in preference
to the administration of camphor in this form of cholera."</p>

<p>Again, in the second variety, cholera gastrica, Dr. Joslin observes,
that "the remedies are generally ipecacuanha or veratrum, sometimes
nux vomica. Camphor is to be given at the outset. Put two or three
globules of the third of ipecac. in a little <span class="pagenum"><a id="page152"></a>[p.152]</span> sugar of milk
and place them on the tongue. This may be repeated, if necessary, in
half an hour, an hour, or an hour and a half. But if the disease is not
checked, give veratrum or other medicines according to the different
indications." Again, in the third variety, cholera spasmodica, "the
remedies are camphor, cuprum metallicum, and veratrum. If camphor has
not relieved, give cuprum, and repeat it many times, at intervals of
half an hour or an hour, if its salutary effect is not manifested. If
necessary, then give veratrum in repeated doses, or other medicines,
according to the different indications." In the fourth variety,
cholera sicca, "there is no diarrh&oelig;a or vomiting; there is sudden
prostration of the vital powers," etc. "The first remedy, as in other
varieties, is camphor. If the patient is cold, blue, pulseless, that
is, collapsed, carbo vegetabilis; some recommend hydrocyanic acid." In
the fifth variety, cholera acuta, veratrum is named as the main remedy.</p>

<p>Such is, in brief, the treatment so highly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page153"></a>[p.153]</span> extolled and
recommended by some in the cure of cholera. It is, in substance, the
same as was originally suggested when the disease first appeared in
Europe, nearly half a century ago, and will probably continue unchanged
for generations to come. Of its general principle and its adaptation
to the pathology of the disease we shall speak more at length in the
sequel.</p>

<p>After referring to the pathology of the epidemic cholera, showing its
strong analogy to congestive fever, from the fact that in both diseases
the blood recedes from the surface, and collects upon the internal
organs, inducing a state of congestion, and showing the necessity of
adopting prompt and efficient means to promote reaction, Dr. Massie
observes, "I am not so bigoted, or so wedded to any system of medicine,
as to be its champion to the exclusion of others. I consider I have a
perfect right to investigate all of the different systems, and avail
myself of any information which I may deem important and true, and I
will premise by saying that the treatment I now <span class="pagenum"><a id="page154"></a>[p.154]</span> adopt for
cholera has been attended with more success than when I treated it
under a different system."</p>

<p>"If I am called at an early period of the disease, even when there is
nausea, vomiting, and diarrh&oelig;a, I commence the treatment by giving
equal parts of rhubarb root pulverized, saleratus, and peppermint plant
powdered; one pint of boiling water being added to half an ounce of
this compound. After simmering it for half an hour, sweeten with loaf
sugar and strain, and, when nearly cold, two or three table-spoonsful
of good French brandy should be added. Give two table-spoonsful of
this, taken warm, in connection with the following preparation, viz.:
&#8478;. Pulverized cinnamon, cloves, and gum guaiacum, each one ounce,
good brandy one quart, given in two tea-spoonsful to a table-spoonful
every fifteen or twenty minutes to an adult."</p>

<p>"The patient should be well covered with warm clothing, and bottles
of hot water, bricks and stones placed around his body. This course
is almost sure to be followed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page155"></a>[p.155]</span> by a moderate moisture of the
skin, which should be kept up for eight or ten hours; to do which,
I give ptisans of catnip or spearmint, and apply hot tincture of
Cayenne by flannel cloths over the abdomen; if this fails to keep up
the perspiration, I administer the following: &#8478;. Camphor, grs.
x.; Ipecac., grs. v.; Opium, grs. ijss; Supercarbonate of soda,
&#8456; ij. Mix, and divide into two, three, or more powders; give one
every hour, or oftener."</p>

<p>"In very urgent cases, I have used tincture of camphor, &#8485; iv;
essence of peppermint, &#8485; iv; syrup of ginger, &#8485; ss; tincture
of Cayenne, &#658; j. A table-spoonful, from one to four in an hour. I
have given the saturated tincture of prickly ash, with the compound
tincture of guaiacum, with good effect, in doses from a tea-spoonful
to a table-spoonful every fifteen or twenty minutes. When there is
excessive irritability of the stomach, the following injection should
be given after every discharge: &#8478;. Saturated tincture of prickly
ash, &#8485; ss; water, &#8485; j; tincture opii, &#658; ss. Mix." Such
are the views of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page156"></a>[p.156]</span> Dr. Massie, as presented in his Treatise on
the Eclectic Southern Practice of Medicine. They are confirmatory of
the observations and experience of many other eminent practitioners,
and strictly accord with his views of the pathology and essential
phenomena of the disease.</p>

<p>We find in a very valuable work, entitled the Eclectic Practice of
Medicine, published at Cincinnati by Professors Powel and Newton, a
full account of the mode of practice generally adopted and pursued by
the great body of physicians in the West, the substance of which we
are induced here to present, preserving, as far as practicable, the
language of the authors. For our inquiries are, What are the modes of
practice? and what modes, if any, are consistent with the pathology and
the essential phenomena of the disease? Each mode, however prominent or
however obscure, is entitled to a fair representation in our inquiries,
and should be held responsible for its deviations from the strict
and generally received principles of science, and the consequences
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page157"></a>[p.157]</span> arising from any such deviations, or departure therefrom.</p>

<p>"When called upon," say these eminent professors, "to treat a patient
in the early stage of the disease, he should at once be placed in a
recumbent position, and everything should be avoided which will have a
tendency to disturb the mind, as well as the stomach and bowels. In the
greater part of cases in this early stage, the administration of the
compound pills of camphor, made according to the following formula, is
sufficient to prevent a further development of the disease:</p>

<p>Divide into thirty pills, and give one after each discharge from
the bowels, or oftener, if the urgency of the case requires it.
Occasionally, however, there may be applied a large sinapism over
the whole <span class="pagenum"><a id="page158"></a>[p.158]</span> abdomen with advantage. Greenhow's aromatized
brandy,<a name="FNanchor_B_1" id="FNanchor_B_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_1" class="fnanchor">[II]</a> the aromatic tincture of guaiacum,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[III]</a> may sometimes be
beneficially alternated with this pill. Should there be an overloaded
condition of the alimentary canal, the fluid extract of rhubarb and
potassa,<a name="FNanchor_B_3" id="FNanchor_B_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_3" class="fnanchor">[IV]</a> three parts, with saturated tincture of prickly-ash
berries, one part, may be administered in table-spoonful doses every
hour, and continued until the bowels are properly evacuated, after
which the above astringents may be given; but where the diarrh&oelig;a
is excessive, it would be imprudent to wait for catharsis, as the
discharge should be checked as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>In the second stage, when nausea, vomiting, and cramps are present,
more active means should be pursued. To overcome the nausea or
vomiting, the preparation of Dr. O. E. Newton, termed in the American
Dispensatory compound mixture of camphor,<a name="FNanchor_B_4" id="FNanchor_B_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_4" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> may be used with
excellent effect; it is prepared as follows:</p>

<p>From a tea-spoonful to a table-spoonful may be given every five or ten
minutes; and in cases where this does not act sufficiently prompt, the
following may be administered:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of this a table-spoonful may be given every ten or twenty minutes, and
continued until the nausea ceases.</p>

<p>To remove the cramps, hot bricks, or bottles of hot water, etc.,
should be kept applied to the feet, legs and arms, and cloths wet in
water as hot as can be borne, must be applied over the abdomen and
changed every few minutes; this should be perseveringly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page160"></a>[p.160]</span>
pursued until relief is obtained. Sometimes advantage will ensue from
stimulant applications along the whole length of the spine. Cramps of
the muscles of the limbs may be overcome by bathing with the compound
cajeput mixture,<a name="FNanchor_B_5" id="FNanchor_B_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_5" class="fnanchor">[VI]</a> either alone or in combination with chloroform,
and applying friction at the same time. This course usually checks the
further progress of the disease, and the patient is saved; however,
should it fail and the stage of collapse come on, in addition to the
above treatment energetically pursued, the patient should be enveloped
in blankets, wet with water as hot as can be borne, which should be
renewed every ten or twenty minutes, and stimulants may likewise be
given; the saturated tincture of prickly-ash berries will here be found
beneficial, both by mouth and enema."</p>

<p>Dr. Morrow observes, that "to fulfill the most prominent indication,
the production of an equilibrium in the circulation, and excitability,
the compound tincture of guaiac<a name="FNanchor_B_6" id="FNanchor_B_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_6" class="fnanchor">[VII]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161"></a>[p.161]</span> may be given." This
is prepared by adding gum guaiacum, cinnamon and cloves&mdash;each, one
ounce to a quart of best brandy, and is administered in tea-spoonful
doses in hot, sweetened water and brandy, every fifteen or twenty
minutes till relief is obtained. As a general remedy, its exhibition
is most salutary. In some cases where excessive nausea is the most
prominent symptom, it may be advisable to administer an emetic to
relieve the gastric irritability, to equalize the circulation and check
the spasms. For this purpose, the acetous tincture of lobelia and
sanguinaria,<a name="FNanchor_B_7" id="FNanchor_B_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_7" class="fnanchor">[VIII]</a> with the addition of one-third spirituous tincture
of aralia spinosa,<a name="FNanchor_B_8" id="FNanchor_B_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_8" class="fnanchor">[IX]</a> is preferred. This is given in doses from a
tea-spoonful to a table-spoonful every ten minutes in warm catnip-tea,
sweetened. In very urgent cases, it may be given in larger doses and
frequently repeated.</p>

<p>In most cases, the saturated tincture of xanthoxylum fraxinifolium
bac. may be used with great advantage. It is a reliable, excellent
and prompt remedy. When given <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162"></a>[p.162]</span> in the early stages, it will
frequently relieve in from ten to twenty minutes. In combination
with the fluid extract of rhubarb and potassa,<a name="FNanchor_B_9" id="FNanchor_B_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_9" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> it has generally
proved very prompt and efficient. In cases of partial collapse, when
the patient is suffering from severe cramps, Hunn's Antispasmodic
Mixture<a name="FNanchor_B_10" id="FNanchor_B_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_10" class="fnanchor">[XI]</a> is an excellent remedy. In cases of violent spasms, it
has been administered every ten minutes in doses of from one to two
tea-spoonsful in hot brandy-and-water sweetened, with great advantage,
and it is peculiarly applicable in such cases where there is not too
great irritability of the stomach. In many cases, camphor is very
beneficially prepared, by adding one drachm of camphorated spirits to
a half-pint of cold water and the mixture given in tea-spoonful doses
every three or four minutes.</p>

<p>Dr. King states that in the early stage he has used very extensively
the following preparation:</p>

<p>This was given in doses of one grain, and repeated two or three times

follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dose, one to ten grains, repeated every ten minutes until relief is
obtained. In some cases, however, this compound did not appear to
exercise any beneficial influence. In cases of excessive irritability
of the stomach, oat-meal cake coffee was given, for the purpose of
allaying its irritability, with admirable effect. The saturated
tincture of prickly-ash berries,<a name="FNanchor_B_11" id="FNanchor_B_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_11" class="fnanchor">[XII]</a> combined with tincture of opium,
was used in some cases as an injection, with very good effect.</p>

<p>Dr. R. S. Newton observes that he had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page164"></a>[p.164]</span> also used a preparation
composed of equal parts tannin, capsicum, camphor and kino, with
considerable success, to be given in doses of four grains, and repeated
at short intervals until the discharges were checked.</p>

<p>He considered the saturated tincture of xanthoxylum fraxinifolium
bac.<a name="FNanchor_B_12" id="FNanchor_B_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_12" class="fnanchor">[XIII]</a> the most valuable of all the remedies for the cholera which
he had tested. When the stomach would not retain it, he gave it as an
injection. It had a peculiar influence on the system, and having taken
the remedy, he could speak from experience of its effects. When given
as an injection, the effect produced was almost instantaneous; the
sensation was as if he had received an electric shock; its use was very
soon followed by a copious perspiration. He had more confidence in this
than any other one remedy with which he was acquainted.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright observes that he had also used the neutralizing extract,
saturated tinc. xanthox. fraxi. bac., and the compound tincture of
guaiac.<a name="FNanchor_B_13" id="FNanchor_B_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_13" class="fnanchor">[XIV]</a> He had succeeded <span class="pagenum"><a id="page165"></a>[p.165]</span> best with a mixture of equal
parts tincture of prickly-ash berries and neutralizing extract.<a name="FNanchor_B_14" id="FNanchor_B_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_14" class="fnanchor">[XV]</a></p>

<p>He had always found it necessary to attend strictly to the surface. The
best external application he found was equal parts of capsicum, salt
and mustard.</p>

<p>Dr. Chase states that, "in the early period of the disease, he had
used the leptandrin, combined with neutralizing extract,<a name="FNanchor_B_15" id="FNanchor_B_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_15" class="fnanchor">[XVI]</a> very
successfully. He thinks opium can be dispensed with in the treatment of
cholera altogether. In typhoid cases, he pursued an entirely different
course, and remarked that many cholera cases presented symptoms similar
to those described in Wood's Practice, as belonging to pernicious
fever, which must be treated according to their peculiar character."</p>

<p>Such, it is said, is the more general and successful practice in the
Mississippi Valley, where the disease has several times prevailed
in its most malignant form. For its curative efficiency much is
claimed. Its utility, however, must be measured, as in all <span class="pagenum"><a id="page166"></a>[p.166]</span>
other cases, by the unerring rule, the actual results sustained by
incontrovertible facts. The nearer any mode of practice accords with
the general principle of pathology, the greater must necessarily be its
success, for it is not in this disease, or in any other, that the bold,
energetic and heroic practice, which is inconsistent and incompatible
with this principle, cures, however extensively adopted and rigidly
pursued. For this principle must direct and govern the practice, or
else it becomes necessarily experimental or empirical, and must be
inevitably attended with the most lamentable results.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Section IV.&mdash;Statistics&mdash;Percentage of Loss&mdash;Variable
Results&mdash;Their Cause.</span></h3>

<p>The results of the different modes of practice which we have briefly
noticed will aid materially our effort to discover and establish some
general principle for the successful treatment and cure of cholera. For
all modes, whatever be their merits or demerits, are supposed to be
founded on the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167"></a>[p.167]</span> pathology of the disease. To treat any disease
successfully, its pathology must be observed, and so applied in the
arrangement and adoption of a mode of practice as to secure not only
entire harmony, but a complete and perfect adaptation of the treatment
to its pathological character. The nearer any mode approaches to an
exact conformity to this principle the greater will be its success. The
neglect to conform, in the treatment of the epidemic cholera, to this
acknowledged and universal law, has, no doubt, been the prolific cause
of the sacrifice of thousands of valuable lives. For this principle
is the key to unlock the mystery of disease, unfold the process of
diseased action, and, as an unfailing and definite rule, must govern
all correct theories as well as all rational practice of medicine,
under whatever name it may be conducted. All practice, then, deviating
from, opposed, or contrary to, this principle must be purely empirical,
and unworthy the confidence of an intelligent community. Hence we may
refer to statistics <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168"></a>[p.168]</span> rather than argument on the subject, to
ascertain how far and to what extent each of the different modes of
practice conform to the general principle; and on the other hand, to
show what modes may be at fault, being deficient in the application
of science, opposed to the established laws of practice, and contrary
to observation and experience, and therefore utterly and hopelessly
empirical.</p>

<p>The statistics collected from the most reliable sources, and here
presented, may be regarded as a fair representation of the general
average of loss by the different modes of practice. In a report
now before us, it is stated, "The average proportion of deaths in
Paris from cholera, treated under the allopathic practice, was 49
per cent.; while that under the hom&oelig;opathic was only 7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> per
cent." "In Vienna, (Aus.,) under the former, the deaths are reported
at 31 per cent.; while under the latter it was only 8 per cent. In
Bordeaux, death occurred under allopathic treatment at the rate of
67 per cent., and under hom&oelig;opathic, 17 per <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169"></a>[p.169]</span> cent. only.
The general average in the places last mentioned will stand thus:
Allopathic, 49 per cent.; hom&oelig;opathic, 10<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> per cent." The record
of mortality in twenty-one hospitals in Europe shows the average
deaths under allopathic treatment to be 65<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> per cent., while in
ten hospitals where the cholera patients were under hom&oelig;opathic
treatment, the average deaths from that disease was 11<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> only. In
a report "published by the authorities of Pischnowitz (in Prussia),
it will be seen that 680 cases were treated as follows: 278 treated
hom&oelig;opathically, of which 27 died; 381 treated allopathically, of
which 102 died."</p>

<p>In St. Louis, during the prevalence of cholera in 1849, the number
treated by three hom&oelig;opathic doctors, to July 13th, was 1,567, of
which 51 died&mdash;a loss of 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> per cent.</p>

<p>In Cincinnati, during the month of May, there were treated by the
eclectic physicians 330 cases of cholera and 198 cases of cholerine, of
which only five died.</p>

<p>In the same city, during the same time, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page170"></a>[p.170]</span> there were treated by
the allopathic physicians 432 cases of cholera, of which 116 died.</p>

<p>Again, during the month of June there were treated by the eclectic
physicians, when the disease had reached its maximum intensity, and
many of the patients being reached by the physicians only in the
collapsed stage, 764 cases of cholera, with a large number of choleroid
diseases not fully reported. During this month, the mortality with all
physicians was necessarily greater than either in the preceding or
subsequent month. Including then the month of May, the aggregate to
July 1st is 1,094 cases, with a loss of only 36, which is considerably
less than four per cent. (being 3.28); while the mortality of the old
school cholera practice being 26 per cent. in May, must have risen to
at least 50 per cent. in June, when the ratio of mortality was more
than doubled with all physicians. The <i>Western Lancet</i> for July, 1849,
issued while the cholera was still raging, and speaking in behalf of
the allopathic physicians, observes, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171"></a>[p.171]</span> "that of the cases of
true cholera, with rice-water discharges, at least one-half the cases
in this city, as everywhere else, proved fatal." This confession of the
<i>Lancet</i>, edited by a thoroughgoing allopathic physician, advocating
the interests of that school, must be regarded below rather than above
the actual allopathic loss. Now, admitting the <i>Lancet's</i> correctness,
and taking into account the aggregate loss of only 36 by the eclectic
physicians in treating 1,094 cases of "true cholera," we ask what
must have been the loss by the allopathic school of practice to have
brought the average percentage of all schools up to 50 per cent., as
affirmed by the <i>Western Lancet</i>? If the cholera hospitals be included
in exhibiting the results of the different modes of practice, it will
appear from the reports that the total number of deaths, compared to
the admissions, was, under the eclectic treatment, 23<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> per cent.;
under the allopathic treatment, 60 per cent. This percentage is
confined exclusively to the three cholera hospitals reported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page172"></a>[p.172]</span> In the report of 1832, by Dr. Atkins, it appears "that the
total number of cases" of cholera in this city, New York, "including
those in the hospitals, as well as those reported to the Board of
Health, had been 5,835 on the 1st of September. The total number of
deaths by cholera to September 1st was 2,996." More than one-half died.
"Dr. Buell reports the success," says Professor Clark, "of sixty-grain
doses of calomel in one of the New York hospitals, as 93 deaths in 100
cases;" very remarkable success! the largest mortality in the city.</p>

<p>As like causes produce like effects, we need not be surprised at this
high rate of mortality, for, says Professor Aikin, "taking the whole
number attacked, it is said that the number of deaths in Astrakan
were <i>as one to three</i>; in that of Nizhni Novgorod, <i>as one to
two</i>; in Moscow and Kazan, <i>as three to five</i>; and in Penza, in the
country of the Don Cossacks, <i>as two to three</i>. In the summer of 1831
the mortality at Riga, St. Petersburg, Mittan, Limburg, and Brody,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page173"></a>[p.173]</span> according to the <i>Berlin Gazette</i>, was <i>about one-half</i>,
while at Dantzic, Elbing, and Posen it was <i>about two-thirds</i> of the
whole number attacked. The period of the epidemic, however, greatly
influenced the mortality; for on the first onset, <i>nine-tenths</i> of
all those attacked perished, then <i>seven-eighths</i>; and the proportion
of deaths forms a gradually decreasing series of <i>five-sixths</i>,
<i>three-fourths</i>, <i>one-half</i>, <i>one-third</i>, till, towards the close, a
large proportion of those attacked recovered. The uniformity of this
law in every country affected with cholera, whether Europe, America,
India, or China, is extremely remarkable." This high rate of mortality
is truly and peculiarly illustrative of the inadaptation of the general
mode of the so-called regular practice to the pathology of the disease.
This, no doubt, is the main cause of its failure, and justly exposes it
to the unenviable distinction of being empirical.</p>

<p>The practice of Dr. Beach, the physician of the Tenth Ward of this
city, during the prevalence of the cholera in 1832, embraced <span class="pagenum"><a id="page174"></a>[p.174]</span>
about one thousand cases, of which only a small percentage was lost.
One of his associates, Dr. Hopkins, reported 157 cases, of which only 6
died, being less than 4 per cent., which probably is not much below the
general average of the other districts in that ward at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. Forward, an unprofessional gentleman of Kentucky, treated a large
number of cases, during the prevalence of the disease among his
employees, numbering over two hundred, without the occurrence of a
single death. Another instance similar in principle is that of Dr.
Browne, who reports a case treated by rectified oil of turpentine,
with the most satisfactory and happy result. So, too, the late Dr.
Sharp, of Paris, Ky., adopted a similar principle of practice, and
became, thereby, eminently distinguished for the cure of cholera; his
percentage of loss being very small indeed.</p>

<p>We might extend these statistics and references, and quote from the
reports of many other distinguished physicians who have been very
successful in the treatment <span class="pagenum"><a id="page175"></a>[p.175]</span> of this disease; but these are
sufficient for the purpose of directing our inquiries as to the utility
and success of different modes of practice. It is immensely important
to ascertain, if practicable, the general principle which has been most
successful in the treatment of this disease, before it shall again make
its appearance among us as a prevailing and fatal epidemic; especially
when we realize and duly appreciate its vast mortality, as represented
in the report now before us, that prior to its recent irruption and
prevalence in India and Europe, nearly fifty millions of the earth's
inhabitants have been swept away by this terrible scourge alone.</p>

<p>This estimate may, however, appear excessive and unworthy belief.
Yet the general average for the forty-three years included is only a
little over one million per annum, truly a vast number to be carried
off by the prevalence of one disease alone. But, if we reduce this
estimate within more reasonable limits, and take only two-fifths of
it, or twenty millions, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page176"></a>[p.176]</span> as an approximation to the truth, it
would still be appalling, and imperatively demand, on account of the
vast interests involved, the most rigid and thorough investigation as
to both the direct and indirect cause of this vast sacrifice. It will
also furnish us a sufficient apology for attempting a brief review
and critical examination of the principles involved in the different
modes of practice noticed above, in order to ascertain any failures or
errors that may have, in some degree, operated as the indirect cause,
in procuring this immense loss of life. All must admit that there
are, in respect to the treatment of the cholera, great and palpable
failures and errors which, though they have continued for nearly half
a century, and have been sanctioned by high authority, as well as by
long usage, ought nevertheless to be fully shown and exposed, so that
they may henceforth be avoided. In our examination, there is but one
rule to be observed, and one criterion of ultimate appeal by which to
try each and every principle on which any mode of practice <span class="pagenum"><a id="page177"></a>[p.177]</span>
may be conducted. This universal and acknowledged rule is Pathology,
the science which unfolds and exhibits the nature and character of
disease, and "dictates the maxims of rational practice." It is the
foundation and only base of rational medicine, which proceeds on the
assumption that the nature and character of disease is fully known and
appreciated. This knowledge is not only rational, but indispensable, in

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page178"></a>[p.178]</span> CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;General Principle of Rational Practice&mdash;Dictated by the
Pathology of the Disease&mdash;Confirmed by Observation and Experience</span>.</h3>


<p>It has been observed that the essential characteristic, the leading
and most prominent indications requiring special attention and
permanent relief, are the "Algide," or loss of temperature; the loss
of nerve-power in the ganglionic and pneumogastric nerves and their
branches; the altered or disorganized condition of the blood; the
impaired or obstructed circulation, and the early and direct tendency
to congestion; and that these prominent and essential features are
correspondingly developed, and in their relation to each other are
too intimate and dependent to admit the idea of priority <span class="pagenum"><a id="page179"></a>[p.179]</span>
and regular order of succession. The primary impression being on the
blood, these proceeding, <i>pari passu</i>, together constitute the complex
character of the disease, and suggest the general principle of rational
practice. If our pathology be correct, it must be regarded as the
foundation and only base for a successful mode of treatment, and must
be allowed to dictate the maxims of rational practice in the prevention
and cure of this singular disease. The neglect to apply to the
treatment of the cholera the science of its peculiar and established
pathology and phenomena, or to give heed to its teachings, has no doubt
led to the errors and failures in practice, which, from their too
general occurrence, induced the learned and celebrated Dr. Velpeau to
declare, before the Academy of Medicine in Paris, that "we know nothing
more of the treatment of cholera now, than on its first appearance in
1832. All our remedies and modes of practice have failed."</p>

<p>By observing the fundamental principles <span class="pagenum"><a id="page180"></a>[p.180]</span> of the science of
medicine, and adopting a mode of practice suggested by the pathology
and phenomena of the cholera, these errors and failures, which have
justly brought odium upon the so-called regular profession, will
probably result in saving nine-tenths of those attacked, instead
of losing that appalling proportion, as has been the case in some
instances in years past.</p>

<p>What, then, is the principle which, for nearly half a century, has
been strangely overlooked, and utterly disregarded by the so-called
regular profession, so far as the maxims of rational practice are
concerned in the treatment of this disease? We unhesitatingly affirm
the principle suggested by the pathology of the disease is, and must
be, one that will reproduce and resupply the lost caloric, or restore
warmth to the body; one that will restore promptly the lost nerve-power
to the ganglionic nerves especially; one that will arrest and remove
the tendency to congestion, equalize the circulation and relieve the
oppressed respiration, and thus mitigate the long <span class="pagenum"><a id="page181"></a>[p.181]</span> train of
dependent symptoms. For this purpose, a prompt and diffusive stimulant
is required of sufficient power to meet these urgent demands, and
suspend promptly any further depressing influence or action of the
cholera poison. A stimulant, essentially different from alcohol in any
of its forms, is required. Alcohol, except so far as it necessarily
enters into the composition of medicines, is inadmissible. So, too,
are all those stimulants whose action is violent, or tends to induce
constitutional derangement, or impairs in any way the subsequent
health of the patient. It must be one prompt, kind and diffusive in
its nature, and peculiarly adapted to meet and relieve the essential
urgent symptoms on which the whole train of <i>non-essential symptoms</i>
depend. In short, it must be one possessing the singular properties of
a stimulant, sedative and astringent, especially an arterial stimulant
and antispasmodic.</p>

<p>In confirmation of this doctrine, we may refer to the general principle
exhibited in the most successful modes of practice. During <span class="pagenum"><a id="page182"></a>[p.182]</span>
the prevalence of the cholera in 1832, the physician having charge
of the Tenth Ward in this city, in which more than a thousand cases
occurred, adopted as the principle of general practice in that ward a
prompt and diffusive stimulant, which was, at that early day, regarded
by him as based on the pathology of the disease. This principle
was strictly observed and fully carried out in practice by all his
assistants. The result, embracing the different stages of the disease,
and some of the most malignant cases, was the curing and saving of more
than nine-tenths of those attacked.</p>

<p>Another instance directly in point is the course pursued by Mr.
Forward, an unprofessional gentleman, who had over two hundred laborers
in his employ, among whom the cholera prevailed in 1832 with its
accustomed severity. On its first appearance, Mr. Forward, unadvised,
and depending on ordinary domestic remedies, adopted as the base of
practice in the emergency a prompt and diffusive stimulant, which
proved perfectly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page183"></a>[p.183]</span> successful. Being advised to continue the
same course, should any more cases occur, the result was, in treating
a large number of cases, including thirteen in his own family, that
all were cured. Again, on the reappearance of the cholera in 1835,
the same practice was pursued, with the same uniform success. Can
anything be more satisfactory or more conclusive as to the adaptation
of a principle of practice to the pathology of the disease, or furnish
better evidence of the correctness of the doctrine we have advanced?</p>

<p>Richard Brown, Esq., surgeon, Cobham, Surrey, November, 1848, reports
a case treated successfully by rectified oil of turpentine, the
therapeutic character of which is unquestionable.</p>

<p>Dr. Massie, of Texas, adopted a similar principle of practice, and
highly commended the same to his professional brethren, as the
safest, best, and most efficient in the treatment of the cholera. He
affirms, that of all the modes devised for the prevention and cure of
this disease, none is so simple <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184"></a>[p.184]</span> and efficacious as the one
exhibited in his practice.</p>

<p>The hom&oelig;opathic treatment, which claims to be a complete and
perfect system, arranged and adopted by its originator and all his
disciples, confirms the correctness of the doctrine we have advanced.
Its curative principle in the treatment of cholera is based on a
prompt and diffusive stimulant, peculiarly adapted, so far as it has
any power, to meet and relieve the essential symptoms of this disease.
Hence its success and favorable results, which show a saving of nearly
nine-tenths of all the cases treated.</p>

<p>Again, the eclectic physicians, who now, including all of the reform
school, constitute a majority of the practitioners of medicine in
this country, adopted a principle essentially similar, which has
governed their practice in the treatment of this disease from its first
appearance in 1832. Their system seems to have been more strictly
conformed to the pathology of the cholera than that of any other
school. Hence, their unparalleled <span class="pagenum"><a id="page185"></a>[p.185]</span> success furnishes the most
substantial and conclusive evidence, sustaining the correctness of
the doctrine we have adduced, and the general principle of rational
practice suggested and imperatively demanded by the pathology of
the disease. Their treatment, directed mainly to the relief of the
essential symptoms, has been based on a prompt and diffusive stimulant,
which, fulfilling to some extent the indications required, has enabled
them to meet the disease on each occasion of its reappearance with some
assurance of success, and more generally to arrest its progress or
subdue its power as exhibited in its several stages, and even in many
instances to restore the patient and save life in the last stage of the
almost hopeless collapse. This is clearly shown in the actual results
which fully exhibit the incomparable fact that in private practice
considerably more than nine-tenths of the cases of "true cholera"
are cured, and the constitution and health of their patients saved
unimpaired.</p>

<p>Again, this doctrine is substantially confirmed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page186"></a>[p.186]</span> by the
results of the experiments made by Drs. Hill and Davies, in the
exhibition of chloroform, either alone or combined with other
stimulants. In the carefully detailed account of its exhibition in the
various stages of the disease, it is clearly shown that its direct
action tends to arrest and suspend the depressing influence of the
primary cause, and when properly combined with other stimulants,
affords very prompt relief. The favorable results thus obtained
encourage the hope that it may prove a successful remedy and lead to
the adoption of a more consistent mode of practice in the treatment
of epidemic cholera. In India, in Europe, and in America, it is now
regarded as a very important remedy, and especially indicated in this
disease. As an antidote to miasmatic poison, and as a prompt and
diffusive stimulant when properly combined, it is admirably calculated
to meet and suspend the most urgent symptoms. In short, it may be
considered, in relation to this disease, an excellent therapeutic
agent, and well calculated to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page187"></a>[p.187]</span> form the base of the principle
for which we contend.</p>

<p>But again, our doctrine is confirmed by the experiment usually
termed "venous transfusion." The solution of soda, when raised to a
temperature from 105° to 120° Fahr., and injected into the veins of
the suffering patient, gave <i>temporarily</i> prompt and immediate relief;
but, when injected at a lower temperature, failed. In this experiment,
the sole and only agent contributing to the result was, as before
explained, the free caloric which immediately permeated every tissue,
supplied warmth to the body, relieved the depressed nerve-power,
equalized the circulation, and restored generally the normal action of
the system. Of this result, and of the diffusive and prompt stimulating
power of free caloric, there can be no question. The principle here
evolved, which answered so perfectly the imperious demand and so
immediately suspended the power of the disease, is the very principle
dictated by its pathology. Stronger and better evidence of the utility
of a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page188"></a>[p.188]</span> prompt and diffusive stimulant, permanent in its
character and influence, cannot be furnished; one that will act kindly,
without violence and without any disturbance to any organ or tissue, to
injure or delay the return of immediate and perfect health after the
disease is subdued. Such we affirm to be the principle demanded in the
successful treatment of the epidemic cholera.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;Remedies, Recipes, etc.</span></h3>

<p>Considering the general principle of treatment, and the nature of the
remedy so clearly suggested by the pathology of the disease to be fully
established, it now remains for us to point out some of those curative
agents which may be employed to advantage. It may be here observed,
that among the few that can be confidently recommended, there is no
single remedy yet discovered which seems to possess all the properties
necessary to meet the complex condition presented in a malignant case
of cholera. Yet it is believed we have simple <span class="pagenum"><a id="page189"></a>[p.189]</span> remedies,
which, when properly combined, will prove successful. Among the number
that seem best adapted to meet and fulfill the indications, may be
named chloroform, as the leading remedy on which we may reasonably hope
for success. This may be united with spirits of camphor, the tincture
of xanthoxyli fraxinifolii bacca, the compound fluid extract of rhubarb
and potassa,<a name="FNanchor_C_1" id="FNanchor_C_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_1" class="fnanchor">[XVII]</a> and the oil of monarda punctata, and a very
valuable and reliable remedy obtained. The following formula exhibits
the mode of combination, which may be varied and adapted to suit any
emergency:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>M.&mdash;S.&mdash;From &#658; j. to &#8485; ss. every half-hour, hour or two hours,
according to the urgency of the symptoms and the stage of the disease.
As soon as relief is obtained, it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page190"></a>[p.190]</span> should be given in minimum
doses and less frequently. This is admirably adapted to the cold stage,
and will give prompt relief in a great majority of cases.</p>

<p>In the premonitory stage, it can be administered to good advantage
in small and less frequent doses. In some instances, an additional
astringent may be necessary. The deceptive and painless diarrh&oelig;a
should receive prompt attention, and be regarded and treated as the
incipient form of the disease. According to the best authorities, the
diarrh&oelig;a commences with the first chemical change or alteration of
the blood, and proceeds gradually, in most cases, for some hours, and
even in some instances, though rarely, for days. It is not sufficient
to check the diarrh&oelig;a merely; the cause must be removed, which is
essentially of miasmatic origin. When the cholera is prevailing, and
the diarrh&oelig;a is essentially choleraic, or the result of a depressing
miasmatic influence, it should be treated with chloroform, aided, if
required, by appropriate astringents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page191"></a>[p.191]</span> In the fully developed stage, and even in the stage of
collapse, perhaps no combination is better adapted to meet promptly
all the necessities and wants of the system, and suspend the action of
the cholera-poison, than the one named above. It is a simple, prompt
and diffusive stimulant, approximating the principle indicated. This
peculiar remedy is essentially required, and should be continued
through all the stages of the disease till relief be obtained, varying
its administration according to the urgency of the symptoms. When the
stomach is too irritable to retain medicine, it should be given by
the bowel. Take of the above mixture, one-half ounce, of the tincture
of prickly-ash berries one-half ounce, of the tincture of opium ten
drops, of warm water one ounce and a half&mdash;mix and inject. This may
be repeated after every evacuation three or four times, unless relief
be obtained earlier. Thus, it should be administered perseveringly by
stomach and by bowel, aided by due employment of all necessary external
means for furnishing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192"></a>[p.192]</span> warmth and giving relief. Opium,
however, should be omitted after two or three injections. Its continued
use to check the movement of the bowels is decidedly injurious.</p>

<p>The vomiting and irritability of the stomach may often be allayed by a
strong decoction of spearmint and horse-peppermint (monarda punctata),
equal parts, alternated with camphor water in small repeated doses
every five minutes. This will often succeed when all other means fail.</p>

<p>The compound cajeput mixture<a name="FNanchor_C_2" id="FNanchor_C_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_2" class="fnanchor">[XVIII]</a> is a very excellent and prompt
stimulant, and may be alternated with other remedies with good effect.
It is particularly useful in allaying violent cramps, and restoring
warmth to the body, and may be given in doses of one tea-spoonful every
ten or twenty minutes in mucilage, simple syrup, or, better still, in
hot brandy-and-water sweetened.</p>

<p>The aromatic tincture of guaiac<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[XIX]</a> will be found very useful in some
cases, and may be united with chloroform according to the following:</p>

<p>S.&mdash;From one-half to one tea-spoonful every half hour, or, if
necessary, in violent cases every twenty minutes, in a little sweetened
water. This may be alternated with some other remedy to great advantage.</p>

<p>Chloric ether has been with some a very favorite remedy, and, in
combination with other diffusive stimulants, may serve a good
purpose. So, too, the spirits of turpentine, and the rectified oil of
turpentine, have proved very beneficial, the former in combination,
the latter administered alone. These agents, however, can be rendered
more prompt and effective by combination. It is the promptness, the
instantaneous or electric action like that of oxygen, ozone, and
caloric that gives value to the combination, and renders it peculiarly
efficacious <span class="pagenum"><a id="page194"></a>[p.194]</span> when it possesses the other peculiar properties
required.</p>

<p>In the early stage, sulphuric acid, in the form of elixir vitriol, has
given very prompt relief, and is very highly recommended as a curative
agent in the treatment of this disease. The following formula presents
the mode of its exhibition:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>M.&mdash;S.&mdash;Tea-spoonful in a gill of sweetened cold water every two or
three hours.</p>

<p>This recipe was used in the incipient stage quite extensively in the
epidemic of 1849, with decided advantage. It generally removed the
symptoms speedily, without any other treatment. In the more advanced
stage it was thought not so reliable as other means named above.</p>

<p>Dr. Fuller, of this city, advocates the use of sulphuric acid as
a prompt and efficient remedy, and affirms that according to his
experience, a great majority of cases may be cured by this mode of
treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page195"></a>[p.195]</span> Dr. Cox, of England, has also spoken in its favor, and
recommended its use as an infallible remedy. The eclectic physicians
are entitled to the credit of its first introduction as a curative
agent in the treatment of the Asiatic cholera, combined with the
tincture of prickly-ash berries and the essence of lemon, as noticed
above. In our estimation it may be rendered more effective, combined
according to the following:</p>

<p>S.&mdash;A tea-spoonful in a gill of sweetened cold water every two or three
hours. Thus combined, it forms a very prompt and diffusive stimulant,
and is well adapted to meet the indications in the earlier stage of
the disease. In the last stage perhaps no remedy will be found so
prompt and decided in its action as the injection named above, with the
internal use of chloroform as combined in the recipe on page <a href="#page189">189</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page196"></a>[p.196]</span> In cases of excessive irritability of the stomach, the
following combination was administered with good effect, and was
especially beneficial in cases attended with stupor from the
commencement of the disease:</p>

<p>Of this, when settled, or strained, a table-spoonful may be given every
ten or twenty minutes. It seldom failed to quiet the stomach and check
the motion of the bowels. In this condition the injection should be
also administered, and repeated as occasion may require.</p>

<p>Some advocate the use of the spirits of ammonia and tincture of
capsicum, properly combined with other diffusive stimulants, as a very
efficient and successful remedy. The following is, perhaps, the most

<p>S.&mdash;Tea-spoonful in a little water every half hour, hour, or two hours,

second dose, but should not be continued. Should the first dose be
ejected, give another immediately after the vomiting.</p>

<p>In collapse, which is simply a more advanced stage of the disease,
indicating the gradual failing of all the powers of life, our main
reliance is on enemata, as noticed above, often repeated, and continued
as occasion may require.</p>

<p>Rev. Dr. Hamlin, of Constantinople, observes, "It is difficult to say
when a cure has become hopeless. The blue color, the cold extremities,
the deeply sunken eye, the vanishing pulse, are no signs that the case
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page200"></a>[p.200]</span> is hopeless. Scores of such cases in the recent epidemic have
recovered."</p>

<p>Here it may be proper to add, that a cure, even with the most efficient
remedies, cannot be easily effected without placing the patient at
the commencement in a recumbent position. This appears indispensable.
The patient should be placed in bed and kept there in the horizontal
position, comfortably covered with blankets, and with warm applications
to the feet. Every necessary convenience should be at once provided to
prevent, if possible, the patient from rising to, or standing upon,
his feet, for the erect posture, before relief is fully obtained,
will inevitably hasten the unfavorable termination of the disease. On
this direction, therefore, the physician must insist if he would save
his patient. Says an eminent physician, perfectly familiar with the
disease, "This direction faithfully observed, and good nursing, will
save very many patients even without medicine."</p>

<p>Of the auxiliary aids, consisting of various external applications,
we cannot speak <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201"></a>[p.201]</span> in very flattering terms. To the mind of
the practitioner the more important are readily suggested, and are
promptly employed by nurses in the earlier stages of the disease. It is
impossible for any person to attend on a case of true cholera without
being instinctively moved to apply heat friction, and warm stimulants
to the surface for the relief of the suffering patient. Any attempt
to prevent these kind offices and apparently beneficial appliances
would be unwise, and most certainly, in private practice, unavailing.
It becomes, therefore, necessary to direct the use of those which are
most agreeable to the patient and tend to preserve and sustain the
recuperative power; those which tend to weaken and depress the system
are the most objectionable. Among the number that seem to do good, we
may mention bottles of hot water to the feet and calves of the legs,
hot bricks dipped in water and wrapped in flannel and applied to
different parts of the body; blankets wet in water as hot as can be
borne, and wrung out so as not to drip, and applied to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page202"></a>[p.202]</span> whole surface, and changed at short intervals, so as to
keep up a steady and permanent temperature of the surface; flannels
moistened with spirits of turpentine, or other stimulant embrocation,
and laid over the stomach and bowels, may be employed, as these all,
in some instances, seemed to be beneficial. Their necessity and use,
however, must be governed by circumstances. As we have before said, our
main reliance is on a prompt and diffusive stimulant internally; other
means, at best, are very uncertain.</p>

<p>Such are some of the remedies evidently suggested by the pathology
and phenomena of the disease, and adapted to meet and remove the more
urgent, essential symptoms. They are not entirely new. They have been
employed to some extent in former epidemics of cholera, and have
sustained a good reputation as useful and curative agents in the
treatment of this disease. The combinations here suggested are the
result of observation and experience, and are intended to present the
form in which these remedies <span class="pagenum"><a id="page203"></a>[p.203]</span> can be exhibited to the best
advantage. They are simple, prompt, and reliable, such as will leave
the system, when the disease is subdued, in its ordinary condition,
without any injury whatever to prevent its immediate return to its
normal state of health. Let them be employed, and their utility
thoroughly tested. They will bear the strictest scrutiny, and sustain
their reputation untarnished under the most trying circumstances.
Should the cholera appear again in our midst in its epidemic form,
and these remedies be generally employed and properly administered,
we venture to predict their efficacy will be abundantly proved in the
successful result of saving more than nine-tenths of those attacked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Section III.&mdash;Prophylaxis&mdash;or Means of Prevention.</span></h3>

<p>In presenting a course of preventive treatment consistent with the
origin and general character of the disease, we are necessarily limited
to the means of sustaining <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204"></a>[p.204]</span> the <i>normal</i> action of the system,
and suppressing the operation of those causes which, by reducing the
general health, tend to generate, foster, and develop the cholera. Of
the former so much has been written and published, inculcating the
general principles of hygiene, that it seems quite unnecessary to dwell
on a subject so familiar to the great mass of community; yet, there
are occasions when the most familiar truths have to be impressed upon
the mind, by constant repetition, to prevent threatened dangers, and
obviate the most serious consequences. In no instance is this more
important than in time of prevailing epidemics; for it is an undeniable
fact, that multitudes <i>will</i> neglect the most obvious principles of
hygiene, and tolerate, with utter indifference, the most offensive
nuisance, in and around their dwellings, and if attacked by disease,
will often wonder why <i>they</i>, more than <i>others</i>, should be visited by
a malignant disease, or become the victims of a prevailing epidemic.
Hence the necessity of urging the observance of some <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205"></a>[p.205]</span> of the
most obvious principles of hygiene, in the preventive treatment of
Asiatic cholera.</p>

<p>Pure air, pure water, and a frugal nutritious diet are Nature's
great preventives for the thousand ills of life. These are the great
essentials in sustaining the healthful and normal condition of the
system, always of primary importance in preserving its tone and energy,
and rendering it impervious to any miasmatic or epidemic influences.
Therefore, the tone of the system should, more especially when
epidemics are prevailing, be kept fully up to its normal standard.
This cannot be accomplished without pure air,&mdash;whether our dwellings
be located in the city or in the country; free ventilation of all
apartments is of the first importance. Kitchens, sitting-rooms,
dressing-rooms, and especially sleeping-rooms, should be kept
constantly and thoroughly ventilated; cellars and vaults, too, should
receive attention, and be kept free from a deteriorated or foul
atmosphere. Everything within and without <span class="pagenum"><a id="page206"></a>[p.206]</span> our dwellings,
tending to impregnate the atmosphere with noxious effluvia, should be
removed, and the foul air promptly purified by the use of appropriate
disinfectants.</p>

<p>Pure water for drinking and culinary purposes is another preventive
remedy, whose employment cannot be safely omitted. It is a well-known
fact that, in various localities, wells only a few feet deep, which are
mainly supplied by drainage or surface water, have proved a fruitful
source, and in some instances a direct and efficient cause of epidemic
cholera.</p>

<p>The water from rivers flowing past large cities and villages is often
so impure as to render its use decidedly deleterious, if not an actual
source of disease. In some cases they have been literally so filled
with portions of fish, and other animal matter, that all city supplies
were made endurable only by long-continued filtration. The waters of
many of our Southern and Western rivers are rendered impure from the
lime and surface drainage with which they are so highly impregnated
that they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207"></a>[p.207]</span> often become a direct source of diarrh&oelig;a and
cholera. Pure water, free from the impregnation of vegetable, animal
and mineral substances, should be sought and obtained for domestic use.</p>

<p>A good nutritious diet is an indispensable requisite in the prevention
of disease. The system in comparative health requires, and should
regularly receive, its proper aliment. Its daily recurring demands
should be judiciously met with pure and wholesome food, in such
quantity as can be readily digested, assimilated and duly appropriated
for the supply of its wants. Due regard, however, must be had to the
existing and peculiar condition of the digestive organs, on which
mainly depends the process of supporting and perpetuating the general
health.</p>

<p>It is not the profuse variety and the incongruous mass composed of
baked, roasted, boiled and fried meats, fish and fowl, oyster, lobster,
frog and turtle, with puddings, tarts, jellies, cakes and creams from
the pastry room&mdash;fruits and salads, native and foreign, rich and
rare&mdash;alcoholic stimulants, and cooling <span class="pagenum"><a id="page208"></a>[p.208]</span> ices, but the simple,
plain and frugal diet, properly cooked and particularly nutritious,
that conduces to the most vigorous health.</p>

<p>Regular, temperate habits in all things, are especially commended;
excesses of all kinds are reprehensible. Great and sudden changes in
the habits of living are always deleterious, and must be particularly
so, when an appalling and fatal epidemic is prevailing. Temperance,
sobriety and cheerfulness, regular hours for meals, for rest and for
business, repeated ablutions and perfect cleanliness, moderate exercise
and avoidance of irregularities, persevering self-government and duly
subjected passions, all contribute to health, to happiness, and the
prevention of disease.</p>

<p>Exposure to the extremes of heat and cold should be avoided, and
the clothing properly adapted to the climate&mdash;to the season and its
variable temperature. Constant vigilance is necessary to guard against
the numberless causes tending to produce an abnormal condition,
resulting in the derangement of the stomach and bowels, or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page209"></a>[p.209]</span>
in depressing the nervous power, thus enfeebling and prostrating the
general health. The neglect of these hygienic principles and essential
preventives of cholera may induce the condition which temptingly
invites the disease. Some are vastly more susceptible than others, and
may not be able, with all their watchfulness and care, to avoid an
attack, should the disease extensively prevail among us.</p>

<p>The premonitory symptoms requiring special attention, when the
epidemic cholera is prevailing, are definitely presented in Chap.
II., Sec. 2, page <a href="#page56">56</a>, to which special reference is made. Whenever
any of these do occur, though generally supposed to present no
particular characteristic of the cholera, they should, however,
receive prompt attention. The loss of animation, the depression of
nerve-power, the pain in the forehead and slight vertigo, the nervous
agitation and oppression at the chest, with slight nausea, may in
most instances be promptly removed. They should be at once patiently
and perseveringly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page210"></a>[p.210]</span> treated by the use of camphor water,
prepared as follows: Take spirits of camphor, one tea-spoonful, and
put it into a half-pint of cold water, and give of the mixture two
tea-spoonfuls every half-hour, hour, or two hours, according to the
severity of the symptoms. A strong decoction, or tea of horsemint
(monarda punctata), is an excellent remedy even in this early stage.
The essence of monarda, or horsemint, in doses of eight or ten drops in
a little water, and repeated every hour or two, will often give prompt
relief. Where the horsemint cannot be obtained, the spearmint, and the
peppermint also, may prove serviceable.</p>

<p>Keith's concentrated Tincture of Veratrum Viride is also an excellent
remedy in these premonitory symptoms. Put three or four drops into a
tumblerful of cold water, and give of the mixture a tea-spoonful every
hour or two hours, as occasion may require. This may be alternated with
the essence, or tea of horsemint.</p>

<p>But another more general symptom, which may be properly termed the
incipient <span class="pagenum"><a id="page211"></a>[p.211]</span> stage of the disease, is the slight diarrh&oelig;a,
usually termed painless, though it is by no means always so, but
frequently the very reverse, severe and painful. This at first may be
slight, but gradually increasing, soon becomes obstinate, painful, and
exceedingly difficult to control. It therefore should receive attention
at its very commencement, for it is in reality the stealthy invasion
of the citadel&mdash;it is the cholera. The loss of life becomes imminent;
treatment becomes indispensable; send at once for your physician. And,
in the meantime, continue the camphor mixture, the horsemint tea, and
give of the fluid extract of rhubarb and potassa, prepared according
to the formula in the American Dispensatory, one or two tea-spoonfuls
every hour, and, if necessary, add four or five drops of laudanum, or
its equivalent in paregoric, to each dose, till relieved. In this early
stage, opium in small doses may be given four or five times, but should
not be continued. These remedies, properly administered, will control
the great majority of cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page212"></a>[p.212]</span> If, however, the diarrh&oelig;a be uncontrolled and vomiting
ensue, the recipe on page <a href="#page189">189</a> will be found very efficient, and
should be perseveringly administered till relief is obtained. It is
prepared as follows: Chloroform, two drachms; spirits of camphor, one
drachm; essence of monarda (or horsemint), three drachms; tincture
of prickly-ash berries, two ounces; fluid extract of rhubarb and
potassa, four ounces&mdash;mix. Give from one-half to one table-spoonful
every half-hour, hour, or two hours, according to the urgency of the
symptoms and the stage of the disease. This remedy is well adapted to
every stage, and may be used in collapse as an injection, combined as
follows: Take of the above mixture <i>two table-spoonfuls</i>, and add to
it tincture of prickly-ash berries, <i>two table-spoonfuls</i>; laudanum
<i>ten drops</i>; warm water, <i>six table-spoonfuls</i>&mdash;mix, <i>and inject up the
bowel</i>. This injection should be repeated as often as required. In some
desperate cases it has been repeated many times and the patients saved.</p>

<p>Wherever the disease prevails, all discharges <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213"></a>[p.213]</span> from cholera
patients should be promptly disinfected and disposed of. Bedding,
linen, water-closets, cesspools, etc., should be thoroughly disinfected
and renovated, so that no germ may remain to propagate the disease.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
